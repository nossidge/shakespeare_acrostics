Acrostic Sonnets on The Sonnets

  By William Shakespeare


I - "FROMFAIRESTCRE"

  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
  My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


II - "ATURESWEDESIRE"

  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  This is the palace of the fearful king,
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.
  Without annoying me: and there were drawn
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


III - "INCREASETHATTH"

  I must away to-day before night come.
  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  Collected choicely, from each county some,
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
  Slain by his servant, going to put out
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That I, unworthy body as I am,
  Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
  The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
  They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.


IV - "EREBYBEAUTYSRO"

  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  But I will find him when he lies asleep,
  Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
  But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!


V - "SEMIGHTNEVERDI"

  Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
  In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.


VI - "EBUTASTHERIPER"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
  Such harmless creatures have a true respect
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  He lived from all attainder of suspect.
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.


VII - "SHOULDBYTIMEDE"

  Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
  Hearing applause and universal shout,
  Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
  Let in that amity which you have made;
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  To find out practises of cunning hell,
  I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
  My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


VIII - "CEASEHISTENDER"

  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  And punish them to your height of pleasure.
  Son to the queen, after his own report;
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
  I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
  Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


IX - "HEIRMIGHTBEARH"

  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
  If you do censure me by what you were,
  Give me some music; music, moody food
  Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
  The ancient Roman honour more appears
  Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?


X - "ISMEMORYBUTTHO"

  I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
  Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
  By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
  There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
  Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
  O that my prayers could such affection move!


XI - "UCONTRACTEDTOT"

  Upon this business my appearance make
  Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
  The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
  To leave that latest which concerns him first,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Of either's colour was the other queen,
  True colours, and not ourselves be seen?


XII - "HINEOWNBRIGHTE"

  His rudeness so with his authorized youth
  In whose comparison all whites are ink,
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Were it not pity that this goodly boy
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
  Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
  He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends
  Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


XIII - "YESFEEDSTTHYLI"

  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
  From his soft bosom never to remove,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  Her brother is in secret come from France;
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.


XIV - "GHTSTFLAMEWITH"

  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  To die upon the bed my father died,
  So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
  To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
  From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
  Might be a copy to these younger times;
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.


XV - "SELFSUBSTANTIA"

  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
  For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
  I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
  And throw it thence into the raging sea!


XVI - "LFUELMAKINGAFA"

  Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
  For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
  My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Into one giant arm, it shall not force
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
  Are of imagination all compact:
  For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
  And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!


XVII - "MINEWHEREABUND"

  My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
  I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
  How troublesome it sat upon my head:
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
  But most himself, if he could see his shame.
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?


XVIII - "ANCELIESTHYSEL"

  As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
  Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
  Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
  To be of such a weak and silly mind
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  You not your child well loving, yet I find
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.


XIX - "FTHYFOETOTHYSW"

  From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
  Thy private feasting to a public fast,
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
  For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
  Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
  One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
  To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.
  Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
  You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.


XX - "EETSELFTOOCRUE"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
  Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
  From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
  To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
  Of noble blood in this declining land.
  O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
  Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


XXI - "LTHOUTHATARTNO"

  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  And I will kiss thy detestable bones
  Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
  A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
  Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
  That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?


XXII - "WTHEWORLDSFRES"

  When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
  Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
  His eye commends the leading to his hand;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
  Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.


XXIII - "HORNAMENTANDON"

  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
  My better angel is a man right fair,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  No rightful plea might plead for justice there:
  Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
  And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
  Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?


XXIV - "LYHERALDTOTHEG"

  Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
  You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
  He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  And to fulfil his prince' desire,
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
  Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.


XXV - "AUDYSPRINGWITH"

  A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
  She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
  Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Going to find a bare-foot brother out
  Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
  It is thy business that I go about.
  The one by toil, the other to complain
  Here therefore for a while I will remain.


XXVI - "INTHINEOWNBUDB"

  In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
  No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
  The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
  Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
  Between whose endless jar justice resides,
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Disguise the holy strength of their command,
  By most mechanical and dirty hand.


XXVII - "URIESTTHYCONTE"

  Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
  Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
  O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  To his most royal person, hither come
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


XXVIII - "NTANDTENDERCHU"

  Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
  Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.


XXIX - "RLMAKESTWASTEI"

  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  And the device he bears upon his shield
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  The duke is made protector of the realm;
  Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
  A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  It made me laugh to see the villain run.


XXX - "NNIGGARDINGPIT"

  No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
  Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
  Neither entitled in the other's heart.
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.


XXXI - "YTHEWORLDORELS"

  You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  We tread upon, and never think of it.
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  Shallow. A better instance, I say; come.


XXXII - "ETHISGLUTTONBE"

  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  I do mistake my person all this while:
  Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
  Go back again, and be new beaten home?
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
  To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
  Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


XXXIII - "TOEATTHEWORLDS"

  To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
  Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
  That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.


XXXIV - "DUEBYTHEGRAVEA"

  Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  Be hang'd up for example at their doors:
  Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.


XXXV - "NDTHEEWHENFORT"

  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  Till he be dieted to my request,
  Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Never so little show of love to her,
  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
  Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
  Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
  There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.


XXXVI - "YWINTERSSHALLB"

  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  What you must say; that he shall not perceive
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
  The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Some one take order Buckingham be brought
  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
  A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
  But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?


XXXVII - "ESEIGETHYBROWA"

  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
  Go quick away; the story of my life
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  To the dark house and the detested wife.
  Have you perused the letters from the pope,
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
  Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
  And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!


XXXVIII - "NDDIGDEEPTRENC"

  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
  Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
  If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;
  Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,
  That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Come, come, you forward and unable worms!


XXXIX - "HESINTHYBEAUTY"

  He is their god: he leads them like a thing
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Succeed before the younger, I am king.
  Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
  How wildly then walks my estate in France!
  Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
  Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  And I in all unwillingness will go.
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
  That nightly lie in those unproper beds
  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!


XL - "SFIELDTHYYOUTH"

  Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
  Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Let not the jealous Day behold that face
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
  He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Thy private feasting to a public fast,
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.


XLI - "SPROUDLIVERYSO"

  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Put not another sin upon my head,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Did you by indirect and forced courses
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Is Lucius general of the forces?
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
  Shall have more vices than it had before,
  Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.


XLII - "GAZEDONNOWWILL"

  Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
  And leave those woes alone which I alone
  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
  Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
  When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.


XLIII - "BEATATTERDWEED"

  Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
  These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
  And so I was; which plainly signified
  The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
  Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?


XLIV - "OFSMALLWORTHHE"

  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
  She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
  Matter against me; and his eye reviled
  All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
  Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  What, will you walk with me about the town,
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
  Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
  Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
  Either of you to be the other's end.


XLV - "LDTHENBEINGASK"

  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Breaking his oath and resolution like
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  If any such be here--as God forbid!--
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
  And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
  Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.


XLVI - "DWHEREALLTHYBE"

  Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  He hath some message to deliver us.
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Then let confusion of one part confirm
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
  Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.


XLVII - "AUTYLIESWHEREA"

  As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  To meet me at the consecrated fount
  You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
  Were equal poise of sin and charity.
  He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.


XLVIII - "LLTHETREASUREO"

  Latter end of a play, before the duke:
  Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
  Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
  Under whose government come they along?
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Or whether revolution be the same.


XLIX - "FTHYLUSTYDAYST"

  Further I say and further will maintain
  To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
  He is attended with a desperate train,
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
  Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
  Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
  Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
  Dear amity and everlasting love.
  Antony call; I see him rouse himself
  Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
  They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.


L - "OSAYWITHINTHIN"

  O, sure I am, the wits of former days
  Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
  An't please your grace, here my commission stays,
  You have received your griefs; nor are they such
  When others would give life and bring a tomb.
  I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
  That ever spider twisted from her womb
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
  I am ambitious for a motley coat.
  Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
  Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,
  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
  I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
  Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.


LI - "EOWNDEEPSUNKEN"

  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
  What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.
  Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
  Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
  Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
  Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.


LII - "EYESWEREANALLE"

  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  And keep invention in a noted weed,
  Not knowing them until we know their grave:
  A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


LIII - "ATINGSHAMEANDT"

  All the charactery of my sad brows:
  Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  In no less working than are swords and bows
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Gather the sequel by that went before.
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
  Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
  My substance should be statue in thy stead.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  As this hath made me. Who was he that said
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
  The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.


LIV - "HRIFTLESSPRAIS"

  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  I know thy constellation is right apt
  For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
  Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
  Propinquity and property of blood,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
  If you would walk in absence of the sun.
  She locks her lily fingers one in one.


LV - "EHOWMUCHMOREPR"

  Early and late, debating to and fro
  How many things by season season'd are
  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
  With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
  Must be provided for: and you shall put
  Under what colour he commits this ill.
  Consisting equally of horse and foot;
  Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
  May I with right and conscience make this claim?
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!


LVI - "AISEDESERVEDTH"

  Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Environed with a wilderness of sea,
  Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
  To have his sight thither and back again.
  Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?


LVII - "YBEAUTYSUSEIFT"

  Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
  Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.


LVIII - "HOUCOULDSTANSW"

  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
  Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
  Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!


LIX - "ERTHISFAIRCHIL"

  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
  I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
  And all the peers and nobles of the realm
  Into the good thoughts of the world again,
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
  Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.


LX - "DOFMINESHALLSU"

  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
  I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
  Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
  His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  Looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
  Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
  Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.


LXI - "MMYCOUNTANDMAK"

  Myself, as far as I could well discern
  Merrily, merrily shall I live now
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
  O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  The sight whereof I think you had from me,
  And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
  Not like to me, or any of my kin,
  Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
  My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
  Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.


LXII - "EMYOLDEXCUSEPR"

  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
  You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
  Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
  Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
  Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
 eXposing what is mortal and unsure
  Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


LXIII - "OVINGHISBEAUTY"

  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
  His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
  You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.


LXIV - "BYSUCCESSIONTH"

  By strangling thee in her accursed womb
  You have received your griefs; nor are they such
  Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
  Cannot stand under them: if you omit
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  So many guests invite as here are writ.
  She either gives a stomach and no food-
  If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  How he received you, let me be resolved.


LXV - "INETHISWERETOB"

  I would, while it was smiling in my face,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
  He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
  I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  When I behold the violet past prime,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
  But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.


LXVI - "ENEWMADEWHENTH"

  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
  Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
  All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
  Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
  Here at the palace I will rest awhile.


LXVII - "OUARTOLDANDSEE"

  O, well did he become that lion's robe
  Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  And make a sop of all this solid globe:
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Driving back shadows over louring hills:
  Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


LXVIII - "THYBLOODWARMWH"

  That proof is call'd impossibility.
  Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
  Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
  But in the onset come; so shall I taste
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?


LXIX - "ENTHOUFEELSTIT"

  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
  Some nobler token I have kept apart
  That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
  I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  Tell me wherein have I offended most?


LXX - "COLDLOOKINTHYG"

  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
  Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
  That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
  Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
  Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
  Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.


LXXI - "LASSANDTELLTHE"

  Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
  A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
  Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
  She said so: I must needs report the truth.
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.


LXXII - "FACETHOUVIEWES"

  For long agone I have forgot to court;
  Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,
  Came from the north and thus it did import:
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  I would entreat you rather to put on
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.


LXXIII - "TNOWISTHETIMET"

  Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
  No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
  One drunkard loves another of the name.
  Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
  If I depart from thee, I cannot live;
  Say that I wish he never find more cause
  Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
  I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
  Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  These present-absent with swift motion slide.


LXXIV - "HATFACESHOULDF"

  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  And bless it to all fair prosperity:
  That is to see how deep my grave is made;
  From open haunts and popularity.
  And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
  Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?


LXXV - "ORMANOTHERWHOS"

  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  My strength can give you: then no more remains,
  As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
  Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?


LXXVI - "EFRESHREPAIRIF"

  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
  Her inclination, let him not leave out
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  And therefore to your fair no painting set;
  I would not yield to be your house's guest;
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!


LXXVII - "NOWTHOUNOTRENE"

  Not three hours' travel from this very place.
  On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
  What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
  Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Nor can one England brook a double reign,
  Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
  Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


LXXVIII - "WESTTHOUDOSTBE"

  With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
  To endless date of never-ending woes?
  This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  Death is the fairest cover for her shame
  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame,
  Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
  Be happy that my arms are out of use:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


LXXIX - "GUILETHEWORLDU"

  Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  I from my mistress come to you in post;
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
  Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  What, what? first praise me and again say no?
  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!


LXXX - "NBLESSSOMEMOTH"

  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
  Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Save base authority from others' books
  She marking them begins a wailing note
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  On such a full sea are we now afloat;
  My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  May you a better feast never behold,
  Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
  Take up this mangled matter at the best:
  His soul and body to their lasting rest.


LXXXI - "ERFORWHEREISSH"

  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Retaining but a quantity of life,
  From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
  Of my consent that she should be your wife.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Where money is, and I no question make
  He hath refused it in the open court:
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  I prithee, lady, go away with me.
  Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.


LXXXII - "ESOFAIRWHOSEUN"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Few come within the compass of my curse,--
  And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
  In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Without the sensible and true avouch
  How would it fare with your departed souls?
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.


LXXXIII - "EARDWOMBDISDAI"

  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  And unperceived fly with the filth away;
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
  Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
  O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
  Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
  Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
  Do not infest your mind with beating on
  I must needs say you have a little fault:
  Surely, by all the glory you have won,
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
  I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?


LXXXIV - "NSTHETILLAGEOF"

  Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
  Is not a single doom; in the name lay
  Levy great sums of money through the realm
  Laid any scruple in your way, which might
  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;
  Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.


LXXXV - "THYHUSBANDRYOR"

  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
  He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
  You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
  Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
  A sunny look of his would soon repair
  Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
  O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


LXXXVI - "WHOISHESOFONDW"

  Why, this is to have a name in great men's
  He apprehends a world of figures here,
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
  Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
  How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  Of his profession, that his good receipt
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.


LXXXVII - "ILLBETHETOMBOF"

  I do assure thee, father, so it is.
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Breaking his oath and resolution like
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
  Being in night, all this is but a dream,
  O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
  Fair payment for foul words is more than due.


LXXXVIII - "HISSELFLOVETOS"

  He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
  I send it through the rivers of your blood,
  Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  This murder had not come into my mind:
  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.


LXXXIX - "TOPPOSTERITYTH"

  The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
  Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
  Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
  The second and the third, nine, and some five;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
  That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
  He has some reason, else he could not beg.


XC - "OUARTTHYMOTHER"

  Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
  The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  Yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


XCI - "SGLASSANDSHEIN"

  She is content to be at your command;
  Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
  A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
  She melted into air. Affrighted much,
  As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
  Should many people, under two commands,
  Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  I did so, and went further, which is now
  Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.


XCII - "THEECALLSBACKT"

  Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
  Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
  Aaron and thou look down into this den,
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
  Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
  Blood and destruction shall be so in use
  And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,
  Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
  Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
  That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.


XCIII - "HELOVELYAPRILO"

  He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  And cannot brook competitors in love?
  Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
  Lest we remember still that we have none.
  O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!


XCIV - "FHERPRIMESOTHO"

  From your encounter, then they light on us.
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Put not another sin upon my head,
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
  Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
  To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
  Honour and virtue and conversed with such
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.


XCV - "UTHROUGHWINDOW"

  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
  Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  He that unbuckles this, till we do please
  Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
  I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.


XCVI - "SOFTHINEAGESHA"

  So help me God, as I dissemble not!
  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
  For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  I must confess your offer is the best;
  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
  God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
  And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.


XCVII - "LLSEEDESPITEOF"

  Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  The petty streams that pay a daily debt
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Of my consent that she should be your wife.
  For aye austerity and single life.


XCVIII - "WRINKLESTHISTH"

  Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
  No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
  Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Some purer chest to close so pure a mind.
  This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
  How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
  In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
  So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  He speaks not like a man of God's making.


XCIX - "YGOLDENTIMEBUT"

  You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  Do not abuse my master's bounty by
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Near and on speedy foot. The main descry
  The baby figure of the giant mass
  I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Between these woolly breeders in the act,
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.


C - "IFTHOULIVEREME"

  If to have done the thing you gave in charge
  For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
  This packet, please it you, contains at large.
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


CI - "MBERDNOTTOBEDI"

  Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
  Because that I am little, like an ape,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
  Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
  The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  I could marry this wench for this device.


CII - "ESINGLEANDTHIN"

  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  It were no match, your nail against his horn.
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
  Love is your master, for he masters you:
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  And do invite you to my sister's view,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.


CIII - "EIMAGEDIESWITH"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  My father is gone wild into his grave,
  And a true lover of the holy church.
  Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  If with a lady of so high resolve
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
  What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
  It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
  The people will accept whom he admits.
  Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.


CIV - "THEEUNTHRIFTYL"

  Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
  Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
  Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
  To eke it and to draw it out in length,
  How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
  You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
  Lives in these touches, livelier than life.


CV - "OVELINESSWHYDO"

  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
  I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
  Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
  Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
  You're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
  Deserves your hate; and your affections are
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!


CVI - "STTHOUSPENDUPO"

  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  To meet me at the consecrated fount
  He held me last night at least nine hours
  O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  She is a woman, therefore may be won;
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Prove you that any man with me conversed
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.


CVII - "NTHYSELFTHYBEA"

  Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
  The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
  His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
  That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
  He might have bought me at a common price:
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  By such invention as I can devise?
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.


CVIII - "UTYSLEGACYNATU"

  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  To make a shaking fever in your walls,
  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  All our love is lost, for Love is dead
  Can justly praise but what he does affect:
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
  That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.


CIX - "RESBEQUESTGIVE"

  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


CX - "SNOTHINGBUTDOT"

  Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
  The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
  He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
  If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  By how much better than my word I am,
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
  On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
  Tell me, was he arrested on a band?


CXI - "HLENDANDBEINGF"

  Have any resting for her true king's queen.
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
  Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
  Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
  Grew a companion to the common streets,
  Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?


CXII - "RANKSHELENDSTO"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
  Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
  Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
  Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  The world hath noted, and your name is great
  Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.


CXIII - "THOSEAREFREETH"

  That the fixed sentinels almost receive
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  O miracle of men!--him did you leave--
  Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  As you are great, be pitifully good:
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.


CXIV - "ENBEAUTEOUSNIG"

  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  No more pains for those thanks than you took pains
  Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.


CXV - "GARDWHYDOSTTHO"

  Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
  As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
  When Talbot hath set footing once in France
  He should have had a volume of farewells;
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  There stay until the twelve celestial signs
  Ten years are spent since first he undertook
  He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.


CXVI - "UABUSETHEBOUNT"

  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
  Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  To help King Edward in his time of storm,
  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,
  O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
  There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.


CXVII - "EOUSLARGESSGIV"

  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Upon this business my appearance make
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  And found such fair assistance in my verse
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
  Some nobler token I have kept apart
  Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


CXVIII - "ENTHEETOGIVEPR"

  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  How many be commanded that command!
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
  One way or other, she is for a king;
  Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
  It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!


CXIX - "OFITLESSUSURER"

  Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
  For I have heard him say a thousand times
  If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
  The world and my great office will sometimes
  Last, and as much containing as all these,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
  Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
  Upon the heavy middle of the night
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!


CXX - "WHYDOSTTHOUUSE"

  Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
  How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  You love the breeder better than the male.
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  O, what a mansion have those vices got
  Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
  Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
  That in the ocean seeks another drop,
  He hath not told us of the captain yet:
  Of any king's in Europe. I do think
  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


CXXI - "SOGREATASUMOFS"

  She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
  To walk where any honest man resort.
  And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
  Such harmless creatures have a true respect
  Up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
  O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
  France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?


CXXII - "UMSYETCANSTNOT"

  Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
  Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
  So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
  You understand me- over and beside
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
  Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
  Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
  That we may know the traitors and the truth!


CXXIII - "LIVEFORHAVINGT"

  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  For I am sick and capable of fears,
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  At least into a jealousy so strong
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!


CXXIV - "RAFFICWITHTHYS"

  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  And chase the native beauty from his cheek
  Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
  For in this rapture I shall surely speak
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
  With other princes that may best be spared,
  I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
  These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
  Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  So much as of a thought of ill in him.


CXXV - "ELFALONETHOUOF"

  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
  For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
  And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Or the light loss of England for a friend:
  Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.


CXXVI - "THYSELFTHYSWEE"

  Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
  For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
  Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
  How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
  Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  Was of more danger, did compound for her
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


CXXVII - "TSELFDOSTDECEI"

  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
  So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
  For they are actions that a man might play;
  Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
  Open your gates and gives the victors way.
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?


CXXVIII - "VETHENHOWWHENN"

  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
  O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
  Well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
  When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
  Not having that, which, having, makes them short.


CXXIX - "ATURECALLSTHEE"

  As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
  That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
  A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.


CXXX - "TOBEGONEWHATAC"

  The violence of either thee becomes,
  O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
  But, noble as he is, look where he comes.
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
  Have you perused the letters from the pope,
  And at her heels a huge infectious troop
  The action of good women: there is hope
  And let her read it in thy looks at board:
  Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord?


CXXXI - "CEPTABLEAUDITC"

  Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
  By law and process of great nature thence
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
  I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
  That droops his sapless branches to the ground;
  Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.


CXXXII - "ANSTTHOULEAVET"

  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
  That wear upon your virgin branches yet
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
  Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  The king is full of grace and fair regard.


CXXXIII - "HYUNUSEDBEAUTY"

  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
  Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
  Under whose colours he had fought so long.
  That tremble at the imagination?
  You were of our determination!


CXXXIV - "MUSTBETOMBDWIT"

  Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  So sure I swear to get the town or die.
  The queen is coming with a puissant host;
  Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
  Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
  What, is the jay more precious than the lark
  I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
  Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.


CXXXV - "HTHEEWHICHUSED"

  Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
  Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,
  Have hent the gates, and very near upon
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
  Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
  Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.


CXXXVI - "LIVESTHEXECUTO"

  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
  He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
 eXcuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!


CXXXVII - "RTOBETHOSEHOUR"

  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  But let me hear the letter of your friend.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
  His antidotes are poison, and he slays
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  Of all treasons, we still see them reveal
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


CXXXVIII - "STHATWITHGENTL"

  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
  That give you cause to prove my saying true.
  How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
  And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
  I once did lend my body for his wealth;
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.


CXXXIX - "EWORKDIDFRAMET"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  We, poising us in her defective scale,
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  I had a wound here that was like a T,
  Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
  For through the painter must you see his skill,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  As one relying on your lordship's will
  My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  That should have murdered Bassianus here.


CXL - "HELOVELYGAZEWH"

  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
  Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
  Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Which yet from her by no means can I get.
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.


CXLI - "EREEVERYEYEDOT"

  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  You have the honey still, but these the gall;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
  Or we are Romans and will give you that
  The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.


CXLII - "HDWELLWILLPLAY"

  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
  I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
  Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
  Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
  You heard her say herself, it was not I.


CXLIII - "THETYRANTSTOTH"

  To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  As the death-bed whereon it must expire
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
  Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
  The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.


CXLIV - "EVERYSAMEANDTH"

  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
  Madam, I am protector of the realm;
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.


CXLV - "ATUNFAIRWHICHF"

  About surrender up of Aquitaine
  Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
  Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
  Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
  For I am almost ready to dissolve,
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  If with a lady of so high resolve
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  What nearer debt in all humanity
  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
  If I were much in love with vanity!
  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
  For it depends upon that love of thine.


CXLVI - "AIRLYDOTHEXCEL"

  Adonis painted by a running brook,
  I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Letters of commendations to the king.
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
  Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
  Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
  He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
 eXcept some petty towns of no import:
  Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Leaving thee living in posterity?


CXLVII - "FORNEVERRESTIN"

  Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
  The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
  I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
  Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.


CXLVIII - "GTIMELEADSSUMM"

  Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
  Thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king
  I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
  My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
  Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
  So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
  Shall I forget myself to be myself?
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.
  My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.


CXLIX - "ERONTOHIDEOUSW"

  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  O any thing, of nothing first create!
  Unto a woman, happy but for me,
  She throws her eyes about the painting round,
  Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!


CL - "INTERANDCONFOU"

  If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
  Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
  To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
  And as one shifts, another straight ensues:
  Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  Commend me to my brother: soon at night
  O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
  For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
  O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.


CLI - "NDSHIMTHERESAP"

  No! why? When he that is my husband now
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
  He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
  I do beweep to many simple gulls
  March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
  The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
  Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Show duty, as mistaken all this while
  And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
  Please you draw near. Louder the music there!


CLII - "CHEQUEDWITHFRO"

  Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
  How like the prodigal doth she return,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
  Who in this dull and long-continued truce
  In having much, torments us with defect
  The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
  He lived from all attainder of suspect.
  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!


CLIII - "STANDLUSTYLEAV"

  Suppose within the girdle of these walls
  To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
  Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
  No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
  Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
  That some would sing, some other in their bills
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  A proof of strength she could not publish more,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


CLIV - "ESQUITEGONEBEA"

  Each one demand an answer to his part
  See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
  Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
  Other offenders we will pause upon.
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  But not so citizen a wanton as
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  A son of mine, which long I have not seen.


CLV - "UTYOERSNOWDAND"

  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
  Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?


CLVI - "BARENESSEVERYW"

  Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  She did disdain my child, and stood between
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?


CLVII - "HERETHENWERENO"

  Having been well, that would have made me sick,
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
  Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
  Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  No, my good lord; I met him back again.
  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?


CLVIII - "TSUMMERSDISTIL"

  That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
  So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.
  Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
  Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.


CLIX - "LATIONLEFTALIQ"

  Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
  And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
  The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
  I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
  The napless vesture of humility;
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Losing both beauty and utility.
  If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
  Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!


CLX - "UIDPRISONERPEN"

  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
  Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
  Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.


CLXI - "TINWALLSOFGLAS"

  To drink small beer: all the realm shall be in
  If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
  And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
  Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
  Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
  Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
  Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
  Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.


CLXII - "SBEAUTYSEFFECT"

  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  The moist impediments unto my speech,
  You may my glories and my state depose,
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  For this they have been thoughtful to invest
  For it no form delivers to the heart
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Call for the music in the other room.
  Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.


CLXIII - "WITHBEAUTYWERE"

  Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
  How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
  Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  The king's attorney on the contrary
  Your leave and favour to return to France;
  When you have pushed out your gates the very
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


CLXIV - "BEREFTNORITNOR"

  Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  For I by vow am so embodied yours,
  To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Of all the gentry; for the most part such
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Offended us you have not, but the king.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


CLXV - "NOREMEMBRANCEW"

  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  My speech should fall into such vile success
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
  Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
  No, my good lord; I met him back again.
  Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Where it seems best unto your royal self.


CLXVI - "HATITWASBUTFLO"

  He should have had a volume of farewells;
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  I have forsworn his bed and company.
  The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
  Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
  Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
  But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


CLXVII - "WERSDISTILLDTH"

  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
  Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Some few odd lads that you remember not.
  To some retention and appointed guard;
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Do in his name religiously demand
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.


CLXVIII - "OUGHTHEYWITHWI"

  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
  Help me this once, that France may get the field.
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Which presently they read; on whose contents,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.


CLXIX - "NTERMEETLEESEB"

  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  That was not born of woman? Such a one
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  My age was never tainted with such shame.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  To those two armies that would let him go,
  Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.


CLXX - "UTTHEIRSHOWTHE"

  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  The lesser thing should not the greater hide;
  The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
  Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
  Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.


CLXXI - "IRSUBSTANCESTI"

  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
  Unless the master were the man. How now!
  But when contention and occasion meet,
  Seeming to bury that posterity
  The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
  And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
  Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
  Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.


CLXXII - "LLLIVESSWEETTH"

  Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
  I speak of Africa and golden joys.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your
  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  Have you importuned him by any means?


CLXXIII - "ENLETNOTWINTER"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
  Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  That honour saved may upon asking give?
  Who of their broken debtors take a third,
  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


CLXXIV - "SRAGGEDHANDDEF"

  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
  Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
  Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Have done the time more benefit and graced
  As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
  No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Far more, far more to you do I decline.


CLXXV - "ACEINTHEETHYSU"

  A mother's tears in passion for her son:
  Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
  Hop forty paces through the public street;
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
  Under whose government come they along?


CLXXVI - "MMERERETHOUBED"

  More stronger to direct you than yourself,
  Mars's hot minion is returned again;
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.


CLXXVII - "ISTILLDMAKESWE"

  I do pronounce him in that very shape
  Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
  The happy tidings of his good escape.
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
  Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
  A little little grave, an obscure grave;
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
  We still have judgment here; that we but teach
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


CLXXVIII - "ETSOMEVIALTREA"

  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  This is an accident of hourly proof,
  So please you, let me now be left alone,
  O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
  My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
  Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
  That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.


CLXXIX - "SURETHOUSOMEPL"

  So holy and so perfect is my love,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Making them proud of his humility,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
  Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!


CLXXX - "ACEWITHBEAUTYS"

  Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
  I see your brows are full of discontent,
  Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
  How can my Muse want subject to invent,
  But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.


CLXXXI - "TREASUREEREITB"

  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  Under the canopies of costly state,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Into your idle over-handled theme:
  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
  But that I was a journeyman to grief?


CLXXXII - "ESELFKILLDTHAT"

  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  So holy and so perfect is my love,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
  Freely to render what we have in charge;
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  I long to know the truth hereof at large.
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
  Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
  To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
  Have I since your departure had, my lords.
  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.


CLXXXIII - "USEISNOTFORBID"

  Usurps the regal title and the seat
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  It is the humane way: the other course
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
  O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
  Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.


CLXXXIV - "DENUSURYWHICHH"

  Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  No want of conscience hold it that I call
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
  Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
  In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
  CORIOLANUS,
  He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.


CLXXXV - "APPIESTHOSETHA"

  A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
  Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
  Prerogatived are they less than the base;
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
  Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
  Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
  Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.


CLXXXVI - "TPAYTHEWILLING"

  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
  There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
  Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
  I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
  Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
  Let this be so, and doubt not but success
  Into one giant arm, it shall not force
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.


CLXXXVII - "LOANTHATSFORTH"

  Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
  He sends you this most memorable line,
  And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
  Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
  So swift a pace hath thought that even now
  For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
  Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.


CLXXXVIII - "YSELFTOBREEDAN"

  Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  For as I am, I live upon the rack.
  That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
  On late offenders, that he now doth lack
  But nothing can affection's course control,
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.


CLXXXIX - "OTHERTHEEORTEN"

  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  This is a letter of your own device.
  He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  To hear the replication of your sounds
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.


CXC - "TIMESHAPPIERBE"

  Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
  I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
  My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  It hath been taught us from the primal state,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


CXCI - "ITTENFORONETEN"

  If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  For living idly here in pomp and ease,
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  Not minding whether I dislike or no!
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!


CXCII - "TIMESTHYSELFWE"

  To be such men as may besort your age,
  I see a yielding in the looks of France;
  My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
  The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  Speed then, to take advantage of the field.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
  We still have judgment here; that we but teach
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


CXCIII - "REHAPPIERTHANT"

  Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
  And well such losers may have leave to speak.
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
  The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
  He lends out money gratis and brings down
  And happy were I in my timely death,
  Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
  That patience is quite beaten from her breast.


CXCIV - "HOUARTIFTENOFT"

  Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!
  The shame that from them no device can take,
  Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
  Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
  To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
  The least of you shall share his part thereof.


CXCV - "HINETENTIMESRE"

  His antidotes are poison, and he slays
  I speak no more than what my soul intends;
  Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Noble she is, but if she have forgot
  To clear this spot by death, at least I give
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


CXCVI - "FIGUREDTHEETHE"

  For here I read for certain that my ships
  If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
  Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


CXCVII - "NWHATCOULDDEAT"

  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
  Therefore I do advise you take this note.
  Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
  Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
  That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.


CXCVIII - "HDOIFTHOUSHOUL"

  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  I see them lording it in London streets,
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,
  He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
  Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
  Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
  Unless it be to come before their time;
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.


CXCIX - "DSTDEPARTLEAVI"

  Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
  Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
  To let a fellow that will take rewards
  Did give him that same royalty he wears;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Please it your majesty, this is the man
  A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
  Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  And kept severely from resort of men,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.


CC - "NGTHEELIVINGIN"

  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  I find an apt remission in myself;
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
  I will converse with iron-witted fools
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.


CCI - "POSTERITYBENOT"

  Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  To set my brother Clarence and the king
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
  To try conclusions, in the basket creep
  You would all this time have proved there is no
  But now the substance shall endure the like,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  To him and his usurp'd authority.


CCII - "SELFWILLDFORTH"

  Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
  Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
  Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
  I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  For thee and for myself no quiet find.
  O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
  How did this offer seem received, my lord?


CCIII - "OUARTMUCHTOOFA"

  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
  And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
  Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
  Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
  There is a remedy, approved, set down,
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  For you all; you have horses for yourselves:
  And stay your coming to present themselves.


CCIV - "IRTOBEDEATHSCO"

  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
  But sorrow flouted at is double death.
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
  This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
  Or else he never would compare between.


CCV - "NQUESTANDMAKEW"

  No, but not yet! May be he is not well.
  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  She would, he will not in her arms be bound;
  Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
  And wears upon his baby-brow the round
  Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
  Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
  My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
  And fit it with such furniture as suits
  Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.


CCVI - "ORMSTHINEHEIRL"

  O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
  How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
  Is to come fairly off from the great debts
  Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  I thought to crush him in an equal force,
  Regard thy danger, and along with me!
  Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.


CCVII - "OINTHEORIENTWH"

  On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
  We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
  Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.


CCVIII - "ENTHEGRACIOUSL"

  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
  Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
  Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  So soon was she along as he was down,
  Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!


CCIX - "IGHTLIFTSUPHIS"

  I'm not their father; yet who this should be,
  God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
  Happily you may catch her in the sea;
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
  I was too strict to make mine own away;
  For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
  The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
  Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
  Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
  Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!


CCX - "BURNINGHEADEAC"

  Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
  Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
  Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
  Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  And then return and sleep within mine inn,
  Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.


CCXI - "HUNDEREYEDOTHH"

  How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
  Unless a brother should a brother dare
  Never to part with it; and here he stands;
  Did call my father, was I know not where
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.


CCXII - "OMAGETOHISNEWA"

  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  Make good this ostentation, and you shall
  And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
  I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
  Should many people, under two commands,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.
  And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!


CCXIII - "PPEARINGSIGHTS"

  Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
  Provokes itself and like the current flies
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
  Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
  I swear 'tis better to be much abused
  Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
  Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.


CCXIV - "ERVINGWITHLOOK"

  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
  Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
  I hope the king made peace with all of us
  The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
  Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
  Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  O good but most unwise patricians! why,
  Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!


CCXV - "SHISSACREDMAJE"

  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
  If that your moody discontented souls
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  And live a coward in thine own esteem,
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  Men do their broken weapons rather use
  And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
  Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


CCXVI - "STYANDHAVINGCL"

  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  And I again, in Henry's royal name,
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
  Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
  And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Importing the surrender of those lands
  Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  Losing both beauty and utility.


CCXVII - "IMBDTHESTEEPUP"

  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
  My father had a mole upon his brow.
  But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
  Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
  That England, being empty of defence,
  He might have bought me at a common price:
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  Using the names of men instead of men;
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!


CCXVIII - "HEAVENLYHILLRE"

  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  And thus he would: Open your city gates;
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  You were as good to shoot against the wind.
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  I and my bosom must debate awhile,
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


CCXIX - "SEMBLINGSTRONG"

  Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
  But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
  It would not out at windows nor at doors.
  Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
  Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
  So I return rebuked to my content
  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  Noble she is, but if she have forgot
  Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!


CCXX - "YOUTHINHISMIDD"

  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
  Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
  Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  In liberty of bloody hand shall range
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
  See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
  My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Doth not the crown of England prove the king?


CCXXI - "LEAGEYETMORTAL"

  Like one of two contending in a prize,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
  Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
  Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  As precious eyesight, and did value me
  Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!


CCXXII - "LOOKSADOREHISB"

  Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
  Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  As where's that palace whereinto foul things
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
  In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!


CCXXIII - "EAUTYSTILLATTE"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  And let the angel whom thou still hast served
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
  Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
  And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
  Thus will I fold them one on another:
  Than both your poets can in praise devise.
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


CCXXIV - "NDINGONHISGOLD"

  Now cheer each other in each other's love
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  It is an honour that I dream not of.
  Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
  Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
  Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
  Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
  Offence of mighty note; but to himself
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  Do challenge thee to trial of a man.


CCXXV - "ENPILGRIMAGEBU"

  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
  Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
  I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
  Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:
  Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
  And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
  Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.


CCXXVI - "TWHENFROMHIGHM"

  Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,
  Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
  His wit set down to make his valour live
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Nay, he must bear you company. The king
  Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
  I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
  Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
  Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?


CCXXVII - "OSTPITCHWITHWE"

  Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
  Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
  That I must yield my body to the earth
  Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
  He that helps him take all my outward worth.
  When they change us for others? Is it sport?
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
  He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
  Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


CCXXVIII - "ARYCARLIKEFEEB"

  A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  You take my house when you do take the prop
  Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
  And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  In his descent than shall my prompted sword
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  From hence your memory death cannot take,
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  But dreadful war shall answer his demand.


CCXXIX - "LEAGEHEREELETH"

  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Let this be so, and doubt not but success
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
  Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.


CCXXX - "FROMTHEDAYTHEE"

  For what, alas, can these my single arms?
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
  He might return to vasty Tartar back,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
  This very night at one another's heels,
  Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


CCXXXI - "YESFOREDUTEOUS"

  Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  So you do condescend to help me now.
  From thence to England; where I hope ere long
  Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
  Unless it be to think that she is by
  To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
  Either to get the town again or die:
  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.


CCXXXII - "NOWCONVERTEDAR"

  Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench
  Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.


CCXXXIII - "EFROMHISLOWTRA"

  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
  In argument and proof of which contract,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.


CCXXXIV - "CTANDLOOKANOTH"

  Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
  The need we have to use you did provoke
  And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
  Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  And ill beseeming any common man,
  Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
  How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?


CCXXXV - "ERWAYSOTHOUTHY"

  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  When I have most need to employ a friend,
  And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
  You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
  Then be my deer, since I am such a park;
  Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
  O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
  Upon my hateful life. Another way
  This house, these servants and this same myself
  Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
  You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.


CCXXXVI - "SELFOUTGOINGIN"

  Seeming and savour all the winter long:
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong
  For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
  Or bring your latter hazard back again
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  The former agents, if they did complain,
  Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
  Of vile confederates. Along with them
  I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
  I have some private schooling for you both.
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?


CCXXXVII - "THYNOONUNLOOKD"

  The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
  Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
  Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
  Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
  On all that need: let me report to him
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.


CCXXXVIII - "ONDIESTUNLESST"

  O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
  In argument and proof of which contract,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  She would not lose it: her attendants are
  That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,
  That I might strive to kill it with a groan.


CCXXXIX - "HOUGETASONMUSI"

  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
  Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
  Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.
  Unless he live until he be a man.
  Since that my penitence comes after all,
  If by the way they be not fought withal.


CCXL - "CTOHEARWHYHEAR"

  Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  He speaks not like a man of God's making.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
  He says he will return incontinent:
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


CCXLI - "STTHOUMUSICSAD"

  See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
  These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  O, none of both but are of high desert:
  Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  So like to him that got it, if thou hast
  I will be thine; and till that instant shut
  Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
  Do challenge thee to trial of a man.


CCXLII - "LYSWEETSWITHSW"

  Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
  You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
  Successful in the battles that he fights,
  Well, tell me now what lady is the same
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
  Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
  Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
  That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
  We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.


CCXLIII - "EETSWARNOTJOYD"

  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
  And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
  O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
  Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
  Joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Yet one time he did call me by my name:
  Dim register and notary of shame!


CCXLIV - "ELIGHTSINJOYWH"

  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
  I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
  So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
  Or is it Dian, habited like her,
  Your master's confidence was above mine;
  With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
  How far into the morning is it, lords?


CCXLV - "YLOVESTTHOUTHA"

  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  So is it in the music of men's lives.
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
  One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
  Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
  There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!
  Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
  As those that I am come to tell you of!


CCXLVI - "TWHICHTHOURECE"

  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  What know believe, and what I can redress,
  Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
  I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
  Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
  How could he stay till Warwick made return?
  This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


CCXLVII - "IVESTNOTGLADLY"

  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
  That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  Gelding the opposed continent as much
  Lest that it make me so unsound a man
  Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
  Your father's heir must have your father's land.


CCXLVIII - "ORELSERECEIVES"

  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Clarence hath not another day to live:
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  If they surcease to be that should survive.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.


CCXLIX - "TWITHPLEASURET"

  To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
  Within this limit is relief enough,
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.
  To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  Unless thou let his silver water keep
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!


CCL - "HINEANNOYIFTHE"

  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
  You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
  I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
  Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
  The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
  He is as worthy for an empress' love
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


CCLI - "TRUECONCORDOFW"

  This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
  For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
  What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.


CCLII - "ELLTUNEDSOUNDS"

  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
  To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
  Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
  Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Sticking together in calamity.
  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
  Us friends; I will pursue the amity.
  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  During all question of the gentle truce;
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.


CCLIII - "BYUNIONSMARRIE"

  Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  I never spent an hour's talk withal:
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
  May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
  And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


CCLIV - "DDOOFFENDTHINE"

  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
  For here's a paper written in his hand,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?


CCLV - "EARTHEYDOBUTSW"

  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  By what you see them act. Is there not charms
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  What answer makes your grace unto my suit?


CCLVI - "EETLYCHIDETHEE"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:
  You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
  Came from the north and thus it did import:
  He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
  I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
  Hop forty paces through the public street;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


CCLVII - "WHOCONFOUNDSIN"

  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
  He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
  Or else return no more into my sight.
  Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
  No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
  Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.
  So many blows upon this face of mine,
  I moralize two meanings in one word.
  No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.


CCLVIII - "SINGLENESSTHEP"

  So long in his unlucky Irish wars
  It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
  Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!


CCLIX - "ARTSTHATTHOUSH"

  A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
  The other to enjoy by rage and war:
  His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
  Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
  Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
  That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
  Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
  Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?


CCLX - "OULDSTBEARMARK"

  On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
  Stay but a little, I will come again.
  That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
  But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Master of this design, did give us, with
  And live a coward in thine own esteem,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?


CCLXI - "HOWONESTRINGSW"

  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
  Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  That I have much ado to know myself.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  I have forgiven and forgotten all;
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
  With this abundance of superfluous breath?


CCLXII - "EETHUSBANDTOAN"

  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Through little vents and crannies of the place
  He gave his nose and took't away again;
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  But you will take exceptions to my boon.
  Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
  O, then began the tempest to my soul,
  And as they last, their verdure still endure,
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.


CCLXIII - "OTHERSTRIKESEA"

  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
  Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
  Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.


CCLXIV - "CHINEACHBYMUTU"

  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  How unremovable and fix'd he is
  If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
  Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
  By what you see them act. Is there not charms
  Your visitation shall receive such thanks
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.


CCLXV - "ALORDERINGRESE"

  As he is striking, holds his infant up,
  Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Into the quiet closure of my breast;
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  So many days my ewes have been with young;
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


CCLXVI - "MBLINGSIREANDC"

  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  By this, I think, the dial points at five:
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  I do not know that Englishman alive
  No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
  Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
  So many journeys may the sun and moon
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.


CCLXVII - "HILDANDHAPPYMO"

  How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  Devised impeachments to imprison him :
  And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
  Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
  And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
  Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
  Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.
  Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?


CCLXVIII - "THERWHOALLINON"

  To make such means for her as thou hast done
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  With those clear rays which she infused on me
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  Or not my father's. For I cannot be
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
  I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.


CCLXIX - "EONEPLEASINGNO"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Never so little show of love to her,
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
  Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.


CCLXX - "TEDOSINGWHOSES"

  That England, being empty of defence,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
  In this the antique and well noted face
  Nor do I as an enemy to peace
  Good time of day unto your royal grace!
  We do not act that often jest and laugh;
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  So thin that life looks through, and will break out.


CCLXXI - "PEECHLESSSONGB"

  Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
  Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
  Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  But stay awhile; what company is this?


CCLXXII - "EINGMANYSEEMIN"

  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
  Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
  Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
  So far from cheer and from your former state.
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
  It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.


CCLXXIII - "GONESINGSTHIST"

  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  It would not out at windows nor at doors.
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
  Shall never see his pardon; for my state
  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
  Hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
  I do not much dislike the matter, but
  Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
  Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.


CCLXXIV - "OTHEETHOUSINGL"

  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  England, bound in with the triumphant sea
  The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  Have not you love enough to bear with me,
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
  It does abhor me now I speak the word;
  Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!


CCLXXV - "EWILTPROVENONE"

  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Which in a moment doth confound and kill
  I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
  Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
  Than my out-wall, open this purse and take
  Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Of thy nativity! I would the milk
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,
  Out of my sight, and never see me more!
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


CCLXXVI - "ISITFORFEARTOW"

  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
  I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  Then in the number let me pass untold,
  For England go: I will whet on the king.
  Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  From high to low throughout, that whoso please
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  That can assure my daughter greatest dower
  O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
  When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.


CCLXXVII - "ETAWIDOWSEYETH"

  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
  With that which, but by being so retired,
  I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
  Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
  See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
  He asks of you, that never used to beg.


CCLXXVIII - "ATTHOUCONSUMES"

  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.


CCLXXIX - "TTHYSELFINSING"

  To spoil the city and your royal court.
  The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
  I must from this enchanting queen break off:
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
  No, I will weep no more. In such a night
  Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?


CCLXXX - "LELIFEAHIFTHOU"

  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
  It were enough to fright the realm of France:
  For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
  Even for this let us divided live,
  And beat the messenger who bids beware
  His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  I am, my lord, but as my betters are
  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
  Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
  Have any resting for her true king's queen.
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.


CCLXXXI - "ISSUELESSSHALT"

  I fear, too many curses on their beads
  She speaks much of her father; says she hears
  Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  She is a woman, therefore may be won;
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
  Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
  The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.


CCLXXXII - "HAPTODIETHEWOR"

  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  Or as thy father and his father did,
  Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
  I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
  Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


CCLXXXIII - "LDWILLWAILTHEE"

  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
  Within thy help and holy physic lies:
  I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
  Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
  As after some oration fairly spoke
  Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
  Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
  The curtains being close, about he walks,
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


CCLXXXIV - "LIKEAMAKELESSW"

  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  In seeking to augment it, but still keep
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
  Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
  And when you find him evenly derived
  Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Let this be so, and doubt not but success
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
  So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,
  With blood removed but little from her own?


CCLXXXV - "IFETHEWORLDWIL"

  I am as like to call thee so again,
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  That of yourself which you yet know not of.
  Had not been here to dress the ugly form
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  Who in unnecessary action swarm
  Or more than any living man could bear.
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  We will persuade him, be it possible,
  I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


CCLXXXVI - "LBETHYWIDOWAND"

  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
  What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
  In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
  And learn me how to lose a winning match,
  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  Do execution on my flesh and blood.


CCLXXXVII - "STILLWEEPTHATT"

  So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
  That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
  I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
  Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
  Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
  Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
  To be the father unto many sons.
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  That when the sea was calm all boats alike
  Than those I shed for him. What was he like?


CCLXXXVIII - "HOUNOFORMOFTHE"

  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  O, by this count I shall be much in years
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
  Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
  Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
  First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
  That hath beside well in his person wrought
  How well resembles it the prime of youth,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


CCLXXXIX - "EHASTLEFTBEHIN"

  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
  And see him seated in the regal throne.
  So is my love still telling what is told.
  Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
  Lest that it make me so unsound a man
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
  But thus his simple truth must be abused
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.


CCXC - "DWHENEVERYPRIV"

  Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
  Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;
  Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


CCXCI - "ATEWIDOWWELLMA"

  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  That tremble at the imagination?
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Were't not that, by great preservation,
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
  And grant it may with thee in true peace live!


CCXCII - "YKEEPBYCHILDRE"

  You have the honey still, but these the gall;
  King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Past all expressing. It is very meet
  Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
  Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
  Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


CCXCIII - "NSEYESHERHUSBA"

  Not portable, lie under this report:
  Say that before Ascension-day at noon
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  But now the arbitrator of despairs,
  And bid the owners quench them with their tears.


CCXCIV - "NDSSHAPEINMIND"

  Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
  Patience is scottish, and impatience does
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
  Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
  Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
  Deadly divorce step between me and you!


CCXCV - "LOOKWHATANUNTH"

  Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
  O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
  He falls to such perusal of my face
  And therefore level not to hit their lives.
  Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
  A goodly day not to keep house, with such
  Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  That is the way to lay the city flat;
  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.


CCXCVI - "RIFTINTHEWORLD"

  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Indeed we heard how near his death he was
  For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  What things again most dear in the esteem
  Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Losing both beauty and utility.
  Doth make an earthquake of nobility.


CCXCVII - "DOTHSPENDSHIFT"

  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
  How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
  So justly to your grave ears I'll present
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
  To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!


CCXCVIII - "SBUTHISPLACEFO"

  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  By nature made for murders and for rapes.
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
  So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
  Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
  Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
  And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


CCXCIX - "RSTILLTHEWORLD"

  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  To have her back return'd: thus to persist
  He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Which to his former strength may be restored
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.


CCC - "ENJOYSITBUTBEA"

  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
  Outside or inside, I will not return
  You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
  Show me the very wound of this ill news:
  Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.
  The king shall be contented: must he lose
  Became the next day's master, till the last
  Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
  Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
  By whose approach the regions of Artois,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.


CCCI - "UTYSWASTEHATHI"

  Under these hard conditions as this time
  To half a soul and to a notion crazed
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
  Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
  And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
  Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
  The kings your ancestors, together with
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
  Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  It faded on the crowing of the cock.


CCCII - "NTHEWORLDANEND"

  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  The great prerogative and rite of love,
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  What the conditions of that league must be.
  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  And death approach not ere my tale be done.
  Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.


CCCIII - "ANDKEPTUNUSEDT"

  Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
  Now where is he that will not stay so long
  Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
  Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  The end of this day's business ere it come!


CCCIV - "HEUSERSODESTRO"

  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Seeming and savour all the winter long:
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
  Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!


CCCV - "YSITNOLOVETOWA"

  You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
  If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
  That he should be so abject, base and poor,
  Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
  Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.


CCCVI - "RDOTHERSINTHAT"

  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Discredit more in hiding of the fault
  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
  They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
  Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
  Into the service of the time and was
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
  Tell me, how fares our loving mother?


CCCVII - "BOSOMSITSTHATO"

  Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
  O heavy times, begetting such events!
  Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
  Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
  The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
  Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
  And the remembrancer of her to hold
  The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.


CCCVIII - "NHIMSELFSUCHMU"

  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
  I swear to do this, though a present death
  Men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
  For this they have been thoughtful to invest
  Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
  Hostility and civil tumult reigns
  Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.


CCCIX - "RDEROUSSHAMECO"

  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
  Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
  Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
  Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
  And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
  My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
  O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.


CCCX - "MMITSFORSHAMED"

  Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
  Myself have often heard him say and swear
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
  Should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
  How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
  Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
  My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Dim register and notary of shame!


CCCXI - "ENYTHATTHOUBEA"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  You have no stomach having broke your fast;
  The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
  He will recover straight: when he is gone,
  A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
  The pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
  That had not half a week to go, like rams
  How many inches doth fill up one mile.
  O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  And better in my mind not undertook.


CCCXII - "RSTLOVETOANYWH"

  Rot and consume themselves in little time.
  Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
  O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
  You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
  Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
  Help me this once, that France may get the field.


CCCXIII - "OFORTHYSELFART"

  O miracle of men!--him did you leave--
  For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?
  Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
  Environed with a wilderness of sea,
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  For these, of force, must your oblations be,
  And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  That hid the worse and show'd the better face.


CCCXIV - "SOUNPROVIDENTG"

  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  Up once again; put spirit in the French:
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Only to show his pomp as well in France
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  In having known no travel in his youth.
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;
  To Italy; and there at Venice gave
  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!


CCCXV - "RANTIFTHOUWILT"

  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  And lay them gently on thy tender side.
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
  The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Until thy head be circled with the same.
  Why, universal plodding poisons up
  In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
  Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
  Tune my distresses and record my woes.


CCCXVI - "THOUARTBELOVED"

  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  Here sits a king more woful than you are.
  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
  But that my master rather play'd than fought
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
  Only to show his pomp as well in France
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?


CCCXVII - "OFMANYBUTTHATT"

  Of all mad matches, never was the like.
  For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  As well descended as thyself; and hath
  Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
  Your potent and infectious fevers heap
  Before I freely speak my mind herein,
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
  Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
  Had graced the tender temples of my child,
  And so I was; which plainly signified
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  The people's enemy is gone, is gone!


CCCXVIII - "HOUNONELOVESTI"

  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
  Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.


CCCXIX - "SMOSTEVIDENTFO"

  Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
  Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
  There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  If with a lady of so high resolve
  Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
  From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
  O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!


CCCXX - "RTHOUARTSOPOSS"

  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  The means of weakness and debility;
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Under what colour he commits this ill.
  Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
  Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
  She shall be habited as it becomes
  Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.


CCCXXI - "ESSDWITHMURDER"

  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
  I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
  That in alliance, amity and oaths,
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


CCCXXII - "OUSHATETHATGAI"

  O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
  Unless you call it good to pity him,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  And he repents not that he pays your debt;
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  That in alliance, amity and oaths,
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  And throw between them all the food thou hast,
  To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
  In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?


CCCXXIII - "NSTTHYSELFTHOU"

  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  She would to each one sip. You are retired,
  This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
  Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?


CCCXXIV - "STICKSTNOTTOCO"

  Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
  I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe
  Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
  Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
  Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
  No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  To melt the city leads upon your pates,
  Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
  Old Helicanus goes along behind.


CCCXXV - "NSPIRESEEKINGT"

  Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
  She's such a one, that, were I well assured
  Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
  It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
  Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
  Then have I kept it to a worthy end.


CCCXXVI - "HATBEAUTEOUSRO"

  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  A private whisper, no, not with such friends
  Ten years are spent since first he undertook
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  An honour in him which buys out his fault--
  Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
  Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  So many of his shadows thou hast met
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.


CCCXXVII - "OFTORUINATEWHI"

  Of all the voices that we have procured
  For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  And throw between them all the food thou hast,
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  With many holiday and lady terms
  Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
  I shall return before your lordship thence.


CCCXXVIII - "CHTOREPAIRSHOU"

  Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
  He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.
  As sure as in this late-betrayed town
  In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Of all the gentry; for the most part such
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.


CCCXXIX - "LDBETHYCHIEFDE"

  Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
  Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
  Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  To say they err I dare not be so bold,
  Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
  You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
  I will entreat you, when you see my son,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


CCCXXX - "SIREOCHANGETHY"

  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Her grief, but not her grief's true quality:
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
  Her immortality, and made her thrall
  You shall have me assisting you in all.


CCCXXXI - "THOUGHTTHATIMA"

  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
  The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  And most deceiving when it seems most just;
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  Incite them to quick motion; for I must
  My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
  A senseless help when help past sense we deem.


CCCXXXII - "YCHANGEMYMINDS"

  You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
  Her injury the beadle to her sin,
  And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Making them proud of his humility,
  Infected as her life, she would not live
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Depose him in the justice of his cause.
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.


CCCXXXIII - "HALLHATEBEFAIR"

  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  He did solicit you in free contempt
  And prologue to the omen coming on,
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  But by self-danger, you should tread a course
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  For hither we have broken in by force.
  And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
  Into the danger of this adverse town;
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.


CCCXXXIV - "ERLODGEDTHANGE"

  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
  Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


CCCXXXV - "NTLELOVEBEASTH"

  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  To Athens will I bear my folly back
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Be playfellows to keep you company!
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
  Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.


CCCXXXVI - "YPRESENCEISGRA"

  Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
  Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  See better, Lear, and let me still remain
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Go quick away; the story of my life
  Receive the sentence of the law for sins
  And when the rage allays, the rain begins.


CCCXXXVII - "CIOUSANDKINDOR"

  Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
  It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


CCCXXXVIII - "TOTHYSELFATLEA"

  Threescore and ten I can remember well:
  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
  That in the natures of their lords rebel,
  Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
  Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
  And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.


CCCXXXIX - "STKINDHEARTEDP"

  Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
  That only to stand high in your account,
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  I was preserved to serve this noble count.
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  And golden Phoebus never be beheld
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.


CCCXL - "ROVEMAKETHEEAN"

  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite.
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
  Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  And so by many winding nooks he strays
  Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!


CCCXLI - "OTHERSELFFORLO"

  O, sure I am, the wits of former days
  To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
  Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
  Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?


CCCXLII - "VEOFMETHATBEAU"

  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
  Might be a copy to these younger times;
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  These accusations and these grievous crimes
  Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair
  And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:
  That England, being empty of defence,
  Because I love him I must pity him.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?


CCCXLIII - "TYSTILLMAYLIVE"

  To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
  Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
  Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
  To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
  Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
  And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  I see a yielding in the looks of France;
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


CCCXLIV - "INTHINEORTHEEA"

  Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
  Not he which says the dead is not alive.
  This token serveth for a flag of truce
  How many years a mortal man may live.
  In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
  Nor never look upon each other's face;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Of the most pious Edward with such grace
  Religious love put out Religion's eye:
  That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
  He be as miserably slain as I.
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  And such an instrument I was to use.


CCCXLV - "SFASTASTHOUSHA"

  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
  And, madam, at your father's castle walls
  Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
  That when the sea was calm all boats alike
  As level as the cannon to his blank,
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
  And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.


CCCXLVI - "LTWANESOFASTTH"

  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  That for a trifle that was bought with blood
  Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
  And writers say, as the most forward bud
  Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  For ever and for ever shall be yours.
  Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
  He shall not make me there a joyful bride.


CCCXLVII - "OUGROWESTINONE"

  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
  Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
  The sun will set before I shall discharge
  If you will lead these graces to the grave
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


CCCXLVIII - "OFTHINEFROMTHA"

  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
  That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
  Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
  I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
  Now I behold thy lively body so?
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  For never was a story of more woe
  Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
  O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
  My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
  Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  A gentle cousin, were it light enough.


CCCXLIX - "TWHICHTHOUDEPA"

  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
  Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
  He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
  That was the way to make his godhead wax,
  Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
  Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
  And so farewell, till we shall meet again.


CCCL - "RTESTANDTHATFR"

  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe
  Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
  A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Driving back shadows over louring hills:
  To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.


CCCLI - "ESHBLOODWHICHY"

  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
  How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
  By laboursome petition, and at last
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Whose nature is so far from doing harms
  He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight.
  Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
  Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
  He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
  You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?


CCCLII - "OUNGLYTHOUBEST"

  Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
  Under your pardon. You must note beside,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
  Limit each leader to his several charge,
  Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
  This little abstract doth contain that large
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Unable to support this lump of clay,
  But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
  Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.


CCCLIII - "OWESTTHOUMAYST"

  O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
  Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
  That water-walled bulwark, still secure
  To bid the wind a base he now prepares,
  How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
  Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  And therefore take this compact of a truce,
  You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
  She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
  They only now come but to feast thine eyes.


CCCLIV - "CALLTHINEWHENT"

  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
  Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
  He that shall live this day, and see old age,
  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
  How grounded he his title to the crown,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  The king hath many marching in his coats.


CCCLV - "HOUFROMYOUTHCO"

  He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  From son to son, some four or five descents
  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
  Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.


CCCLVI - "NVERTESTHEREIN"

  Not by might master'd but by special grace:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Till he be dieted to my request,
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
  The one doth call her his, the other his,
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.


CCCLVII - "LIVESWISDOMBEA"

  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  It is determined, not concluded yet:
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
  It must appear in other ways than words,
  Show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
  Deservedly confined into this rock,
  O momentary grace of mortal men,
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  But to be frank, and give it thee again.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.


CCCLVIII - "UTYANDINCREASE"

  Until it wither with me to my grave
  That others touch, and often touching will
  Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
  Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  I lose myself: better I were not yours
  No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And all is semblative a woman's part.
  Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


CCCLIX - "WITHOUTTHISFOL"

  Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  I would not be so sick though for his place:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.


CCCLX - "LYAGEANDCOLDDE"

  Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
  You have me, rich; and I will never fail
  And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
  Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Allow not nature more than nature needs,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


CCCLXI - "CAYIFALLWEREMI"

  Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
  As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
  You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  I am so far already in your gifts,--
  For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
  And all the peers and nobles of the realm
  Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  I know when one is dead, and when one lives.


CCCLXII - "NDEDSOTHETIMES"

  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  Discredit more in hiding of the fault
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  Or overthrow incurable ensues.
  The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
  Here are your sons again; and I must lose
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  This act is as an ancient tale new told,
  I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
  May you a better feast never behold,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.


CCCLXIII - "SHOULDCEASEAND"

  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  And I will have you and that fault withal;
  See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.


CCCLXIV - "THREESCOREYEAR"

  The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Young York he is but boot, because both they
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  As, painfully to pore upon a book
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


CCCLXV - "WOULDMAKETHEWO"

  Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
  Or in the night, imagining some fear,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Let it be known to him that we are here.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.
  And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
  Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  Have broken with the king; who hath so far
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  Of egal justice, used in such contempt?


CCCLXVI - "RLDAWAYLETTHOS"

  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  A man of complements, whom right and wrong
  What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  Yea the illiterate, that know not how
  Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  The action of good women: there is hope
  That caused a lesser villain than myself,
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
  She is not well. Convey her to my tent.


CCCLXVII - "EWHOMNATUREHAT"

  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
  Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
  Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
  A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
  That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?


CCCLXVIII - "HNOTMADEFORSTO"

  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Never so needful on the earth of France,
  On some apparent danger seen in him
  The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
  Make known to you why I have done this. Come,
  And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.


CCCLXIX - "REHARSHFEATURE"

  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
  And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
  Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
  So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
  Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
  For men so old as we to keep the peace.
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
  The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
  Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


CCCLXX - "LESSANDRUDEBAR"

  Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.
  So far from variation or quick change?
  Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
  Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
  A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


CCCLXXI - "RENLYPERISHLOO"

  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  You may my glories and my state depose,
  Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  I do remember in this shepherd boy
  So was I bid report here to the state
  He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
  Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.


CCCLXXII - "KWHOMSHEBESTEN"

  Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
  When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.
  Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  My army but a weak and sickly guard;
  Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  But longer did we not retain much hope;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  That I had any light from thee of this.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?


CCCLXXIII - "DOWDSHEGAVETHE"

  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
  Do execution on my flesh and blood.
  Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
  Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  There is a vice that most I do abhor,
  Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


CCCLXXIV - "MOREWHICHBOUNT"

  Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
  Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
  He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
  But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
  O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  That proof is call'd impossibility.


CCCLXXV - "EOUSGIFTTHOUSH"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Once more let me behold it: is it that
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
  God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
  Though standing naked on a mountain top,
  There's something in me that reproves my fault;
  Here is my hand; the premises observed,
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  How far that little candle throws his beams!


CCCLXXVI - "OULDSTINBOUNTY"

  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
  I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
  Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
  The book of his good acts, whence men have read
  You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?


CCCLXXVII - "CHERISHSHECARV"

  Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
  Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.


CCCLXXVIII - "EDTHEEFORHERSE"

  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Did call my father, was I know not where
  That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
  He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
  Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Since I am crept in favour with myself,
  Else would he never so demean himself.


CCCLXXIX - "ALANDMEANTTHER"

  As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
  Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
  And at her heels a huge infectious troop
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  My foolish rival, that her father likes
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  Has done no more than other knights have done;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


CCCLXXX - "EBYTHOUSHOULDS"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
  You must forsake this room, and go with us:
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  His body couched in a curious bed,
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Until the golden circuit on my head,
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  His promises fly so beyond his state
  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.


CCCLXXXI - "TPRINTMORENOTL"

  That is as clear from this attaint of mine
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
  No; for he could not so resign his crown
  That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
  My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.


CCCLXXXII - "ETTHATCOPYDIEW"

  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  That grew the more by reaping: his delights
  To cast thee up again. What may this mean
  High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
  A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
  Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
  Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
  O master, master I have watch'd so long
  Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
  Your exposition on the holy text
  Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?


CCCLXXXIII - "HENIDOCOUNTTHE"

  Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
  I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
  Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
  Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
  Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
  He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


CCCLXXXIV - "CLOCKTHATTELLS"

  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  The King your father is dispos'd to sleep.
  This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
  Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
  So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.


CCCLXXXV - "THETIMEANDSEET"

  Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
  It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
  More upon humour than advised respect.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  And draw within the compass of suspect
  Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Should have an army for an usher, and
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  To carry into Flanders the great seal.


CCCLXXXVI - "HEBRAVEDAYSUNK"

  Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
  Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  Keeps good old York there with his men of war?


CCCLXXXVII - "INHIDEOUSNIGHT"

  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  No public benefit which you receive
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
  Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Upon the moment did her force subdue,
  See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  God pardon them that are the cause of it!
  He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!
  Therefore accept such kindness as I can.


CCCLXXXVIII - "WHENIBEHOLDTHE"

  What bloody man is that? He can report,
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please
  I could not send it,--here it is again,--
  Braving compare, disdainfully did sting
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


CCCLXXXIX - "VIOLETPASTPRIM"

  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
  Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  And much too little of that good I saw
  Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
  Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
  It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
  My best endeavours shall be done herein.


CCCXC - "EANDSABLECURLS"

  Exist, and be a member of his love
  And is it true that I must go from Troy?
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
  By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
  Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?


CCCXCI - "ALLSILVERDOERW"

  A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
  Spare England, for it is your native coast;
  I play the torturer, by small and small
  Love is your master, for he masters you:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.


CCCXCII - "ITHWHITEWHENLO"

  In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
  The book of his good acts, whence men have read
  His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
  With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Is all the policy, strength and defence,
  These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Where it seems best unto your royal self.
  Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
  Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!


CCCXCIII - "FTYTREESISEEBA"

  For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
  Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
  Your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.
  This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  So did the merciless and pitchy night
  I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
  Speak to the people, and they pity her.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
  And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.


CCCXCIV - "RRENOFLEAVESWH"

  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
  Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
  For I am almost ready to dissolve,
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  Without the bed her other fair hand was,
  He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.


CCCXCV - "ICHERSTFROMHEA"

  If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
  Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?


CCCXCVI - "TDIDCANOPYTHEH"

  Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  If she had not a spirit to resist.
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
  And wild amazement hurries up and down
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
  You may my glories and my state depose,
  The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
  Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Hath been between this lady and this lord.


CCCXCVII - "ERDANDSUMMERSG"

  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Doth any name particular belong
  Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
  Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
  Myself and divers gentlemen beside
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.


CCCXCVIII - "REENALLGIRDEDU"

  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  Let those who are in favour with their stars
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!


CCCXCIX - "PINSHEAVESBORN"

  Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
  I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  But at this instant he is sick my lord,
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?


CD - "EONTHEBIERWITH"

  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
  His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
  In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
  I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
  Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
  Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.


CDI - "WHITEANDBRISTL"

  Was ever known so great and little loss
  Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  And spend your rich opinion for the name
  Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
  Receiving nought by elements so slow
  It shall appear that your demands are just,
  Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.
  To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.


CDII - "YBEARDTHENOFTH"

  Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
  But to relieve them of their heavy load;
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  A thievish living on the common road?
  Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
  Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
  The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
  Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!


CDIII - "YBEAUTYDOIQUES"

  Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
  Be patient, Princes; you do know these fits
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
  Yet nature might have made me as these are,
  Descended of so many royal kings.
  O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
  Is partly to behold my lady's face;
  Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.


CDIV - "TIONMAKETHATTH"

  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
  As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
  Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
  However faulty, yet should find respect
  And in such indexes, although small pricks
  The things we are for that which we expect;
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!


CDV - "OUAMONGTHEWAST"

  Our puissance into the hand of God,
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
  Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
  No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Where I will write. All may be well enough.
  And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!


CDVI - "ESOFTIMEMUSTGO"

  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
  Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
  I would not spare my brother in this case,
  My discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
  Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
  Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
  Go cheerfully together and digest.
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.


CDVII - "SINCESWEETSAND"

  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Never went with his forces into France
  Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
  With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  She is content to be at your command;
  And, of so great a favour growing proud,
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?


CDVIII - "BEAUTIESDOTHEM"

  Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
  Of greater time than I shall show to be.
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  High emperor, upon my feeble knee
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  More than with parting from my lord the king.


CDIX - "SELVESFORSAKEA"

  Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Each part in me that were but sensible:
  Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
  For we no longer are defensible.
  Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Since she is living, let the time run on
  All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Each day still better other's happiness;
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!


CDX - "NDDIEASFASTAST"

  No more than were I painted I would wish
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  And have no other reason for this wrong
  Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
  For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
  After so long grief, such festivity!
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  To set him free from his captivity.
  And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?


CDXI - "HEYSEEOTHERSGR"

  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
  So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
  He has his health and ampler strength indeed
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  So mighty and so many my defects,
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


CDXII - "OWANDNOTHINGGA"

  Out of my lean and low ability
  Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
  Awake, awake, English nobility!
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
  Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.


CDXIII - "INSTTIMESSCYTH"

  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  That I must yield my body to the earth
  The interruption of their churlish drums
  I like you, lads; about your business straight;
  Man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
  Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
  You never spoke what did become you less
  They have been violent to me and mine.
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.


CDXIV - "ECANMAKEDEFENC"

  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Cousin of York, we institute your grace
  As you shall well be satisfied withal.
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  More than the instant army we can make,
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Free from these slanders and this open shame!
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  Courageously to pluck him from his horse.


CDXV - "ESAVEBREEDTOBR"

  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
  Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  By Him that raised me to this careful height
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Drest in a little brief authority,
  The care I had and have of subjects' good
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


CDXVI - "AVEHIMWHENHETA"

  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  He was as calm as virtue--he began
  I am not in the roll of common men.
  Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
  What shall I do to win my lord again?
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Now where is he that will not stay so long
  How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.


CDXVII - "KESTHEEHENCEOT"

  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
  The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.


CDXVIII - "HATYOUWEREYOUR"

  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
  To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
  You must forget to be a woman; change
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
  Which swims against your stream of quality.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!


CDXIX - "SELFBUTLOVEYOU"

  See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
  Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
  By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
  Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?


CDXX - "ARENOLONGERYOU"

  As though she bid me stay by her a week;
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
  O God! that one might read the book of fate,
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Gave me my being and my father first,
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  Of estimation and command in arms.
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?


CDXXI - "RSTHANYOUYOURS"

  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
  Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  Of this escape and whither they are bound;
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.


CDXXII - "ELFHERELIVEAGA"

  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  For exile hath more terror in his look,
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
  Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
  Give me the paper; let me read the same;
  Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.


CDXXIII - "INSTTHISCOMING"

  Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  So should my shame still rest upon record,
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
  Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
  Into the channel, till the lowest stream
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.


CDXXIV - "ENDYOUSHOULDPR"

  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
  Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Please you, deliberate a day or two.
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.


CDXXV - "EPAREANDYOURSW"

  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
  And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
  You have received your griefs; nor are they such
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.


CDXXVI - "EETSEMBLANCETO"

  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  That you to-day promised to tell me of?
  Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
  By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
  Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


CDXXVII - "SOMEOTHERGIVES"

  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
  If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.


CDXXVIII - "OSHOULDTHATBEA"

  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
  Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Unless a brother should a brother dare
  Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
  That in the ocean seeks another drop,
  Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Being once perfected how to grant suits,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  And all of them that thus dishonour her.


CDXXIX - "UTYWHICHYOUHOL"

  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  The place which I have feasted, does it now,
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Were but my trials of thy love and thou
  Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
  Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Of woman in me: now from head to foot
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.


CDXXX - "DINLEASEFINDNO"

  Do in his name religiously demand
  If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  For what you see is but the smallest part
  I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
  No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
  Distinguish him from others, he did keep
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.


CDXXXI - "DETERMINATIONT"

  Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Reward did threaten and encourage him,
  Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  To season love, that of it doth not taste!


CDXXXII - "HENYOUWEREYOUR"

  His father revell'd in the heart of France,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  When I have said, make answer to us both.
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  You would have thought the very windows spake,
  Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!


CDXXXIII - "SELFAGAINAFTER"

  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
  Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
  As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
  God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
  And dispossessing all my other parts
  It is an honour that I dream not of.
  Nor would your noble mother for much more
  And often at his very loose decides
  From a resolved and honourable war,
  The current that with gentle murmur glides,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


CDXXXIV - "YOURSELFSDECEA"

  Your visitation shall receive such thanks
  Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Let fair humanity abhor the deed
  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
  Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  Did seem defensible. So you left him.
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.


CDXXXV - "SEWHENYOURSWEE"

  She should have bought her dignities so dear.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Who hath a story ready for your ear.
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
  Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.


CDXXXVI - "TISSUEYOURSWEE"

  To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
  Into a cloven pine; within which rift
  Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine
  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  Up once again; put spirit in the French:
  Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


CDXXXVII - "TFORMSHOULDBEA"

  The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Married to your good service, stay till death:
  Spare England, for it is your native coast;
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  Business, my lord! I think most understand
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.


CDXXXVIII - "RWHOLETSSOFAIR"

  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
  His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!
  O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  That brings me food to make misfortune live?
  Says that you savour too much of your youth,
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
  As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
  I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!


CDXXXIX - "AHOUSEFALLTODE"

  Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
  He does it under name of perfect love;
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  From whence he intercepted did return
  As nail in door. The things I speak are just.
  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:
  The hearts of all that he did angle for;
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


CDXL - "CAYWHICHHUSBAN"

  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
  Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
  His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
  Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
  Already at a point, was setting forth.
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.


CDXLI - "DRYINHONOURMIG"

  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  I could have better spared a better man:
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  I am so angry at these abject terms;
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.


CDXLII - "HTUPHOLDAGAINS"

  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  Proclamation, and he rails upon me.
  How unremovable and fix'd he is
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Drest in a little brief authority,
  As gentle tell me, of what honour was
  Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
  And therefore little shall I grace my cause
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Nor never did my actions yet commence
  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!


CDXLIII - "TTHESTORMYGUST"

  The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
  The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
  His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
  To one so meek, that mine own servant should
  Of celebration of that nuptial which
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
  Give it an understanding but no tongue.
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.


CDXLIV - "SOFWINTERSDAYA"

  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
  Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
  We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
  Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
  No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  And little look'd for at your helping hands.
  Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
  And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.


CDXLV - "NDBARRENRAGEOF"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  Being the time the potion's force should cease.
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
  For no name fits thy nature but thy own!


CDXLVI - "DEATHSETERNALC"

  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And with the same to act controlling laws.
  Though their injunction be to bar my doors
  He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Remember so weak a composition.
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  And say you do't by our permission;
  Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.


CDXLVII - "OLDONONEBUTUNT"

  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
  Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,
  Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
  Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.


CDXLVIII - "HRIFTSDEARMYLO"

  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
  For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:
  The king and his companions: warily
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And mock you with me after I am gone.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
  Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
  Or that or any place that harbours men.


CDXLIX - "VEYOUKNOWYOUHA"

  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
  Or else he never would compare between.
  Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
  You do it for increase: O strange excuse,
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.


CDL - "DAFATHERLETYOU"

  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  And then is heard no more: it is a tale
  For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
  As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
  These people saw the chain about his neck.
  His lands to me, and took it on his death
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That if it would but apprehend some joy,
  Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.


CDLI - "RSONSAYSONOTFR"

  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
  And he shall signify from time to time
  You shall not be admitted to his sight.
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
  From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.


CDLII - "OMTHESTARSDOIM"

  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  How like the prodigal doth she return,
  Exceed account; but the full sum of me
  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  That's for thyself to breed another thee,
  At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  I love not less, though less the show appear:
  Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.


CDLIII - "YJUDGMENTPLUCK"

  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
  Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.


CDLIV - "ANDYETMETHINKS"

  Although my last: no matter, since I feel
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Till after many accents and delays,
  My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
  I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
  So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?


CDLV - "IHAVEASTRONOMY"

  I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
  How many days will finish up the year;
  Are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
  Something unfilial: reason my son
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
  You know there wants no junkets at the feast.


CDLVI - "BUTNOTTOTELLOF"

  Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
  To stab at half an hour of my life.
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  The favours of these men: were they not mine?
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!


CDLVII - "GOODOREVILLUCK"

  Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  Did he so often lodge in open field,
  O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
  Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!


CDLVIII - "OFPLAGUESOFDEA"

  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
  From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  And venture madly on a desperate mart.
  Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  So that from point to point now have you heard
  O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  As long as you or I. yet he must die.


CDLIX - "RTHSORSEASONSQ"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
  Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  As much as may be yielded to a man:
  Sir, I did never win of you before.
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.


CDLX - "UALITYNORCANIF"

  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  I speak no more than what my soul intends;
  That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
  Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
  And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
  For this will out, and here I must not stay.


CDLXI - "ORTUNETOBRIEFM"

  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
  But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
  My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?


CDLXII - "INUTESTELLPOIN"

  I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.


CDLXIII - "TINGTOEACHHIST"

  The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
  In fellest manner execute your aims.
  No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.
  God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
  That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
  On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
  Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
  I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
  So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
  The danger formerly by me rehearsed.


CDLXIV - "HUNDERRAINANDW"

  He gave his honours to the world again,
  Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
  Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
  If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
  And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
  No, not so much perdition as an hair
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
  With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.


CDLXV - "INDORSAYWITHPR"

  It is thy business that I go about.
  Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Say that I wish he never find more cause
  And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
  Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
  When nature brought him to the door of death?
  It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
  This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
  He swung about his head and cut the winds,
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Rather than make unprofited return.


CDLXVI - "INCESIFITSHALL"

  It is war's prize to take all vantages;
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Study to break it and not break my troth.
  If you were born to honour, show it now;
  For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
  It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!


CDLXVII - "GOWELLBYOFTPRE"

  God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
  Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
  What think you? may we, with the warrant of
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
  Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
  Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
  For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
  The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
  Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.


CDLXVIII - "DICTTHATIINHEA"

  Did all the chivalry of England move
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
  The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
  He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
  And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
  To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
  In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.


CDLXIX - "VENFINDBUTFROM"

  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
  Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
  I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
  Not knowing them until we know their grave:
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
  From whom my absence was not six months old
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.


CDLXX - "THINEEYESMYKNO"

  Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
  Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
  Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
  Out of my sight, and never see me more!


CDLXXI - "WLEDGEIDERIVEA"

  With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
  Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
  Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Is it no more to be your daughter than
  Did to his predecessors part withal.
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And she will speak most bitterly and strange.


CDLXXII - "NDCONSTANTSTAR"

  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
  So honour cross it from the north to south,
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
  Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
  Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
  The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
  And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!


CDLXXIII - "SINTHEMIREADSU"

  Should the approach of this wild river break,
  Is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
  This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
  I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
  Upon the parting of your wives and you.


CDLXXIV - "CHARTASTRUTHAN"

  Coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
  Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
  As much as may be yielded to a man:
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
  And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
  Than that which dearest father bears his son
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  And sits as one new risen from a dream.
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.


CDLXXV - "DBEAUTYSHALLTO"

  Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
  Better forbear till Proteus make return.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  You said the enemy would not come down,
  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
  Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
  And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!


CDLXXVI - "GETHERTHRIVEIF"

  Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  The pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
  He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
  Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.


CDLXXVII - "FROMTHYSELFTOS"

  From any other foul unlawful touch
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  Of all the gentry; for the most part such
  My will to her consent is but a part;
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  He shall not breathe infection in this air
  You less know how to value her desert
  Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Let us into the city presently
  Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.


CDLXXVIII - "TORETHOUWOULDS"

  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Then my digression is so vile, so base,
  His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
  Of the most pious Edward with such grace
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.


CDLXXIX - "TCONVERTORELSE"

  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,
  Or who should study to prefer a peace.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
  Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


CDLXXX - "OFTHEETHISIPRO"

  O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
  He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  The itch of his affection should not then
  His wish'd ability, he had himself
  In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  It is the bloody business which informs
  Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  O you immortal gods! I will not go.


CDLXXXI - "GNOSTICATETHYE"

  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  I spake unto this crown as having sense,
  Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,
  And husband nature's riches from expense;
  There was a pretty redness in his lip,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
  His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
  You cry against the noble senate, who,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


CDLXXXII - "NDISTRUTHSANDB"

  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
  So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
  Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
  These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
  He should receive his punishment in thanks:
  So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
  No less in pity than his glory which
  Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
  But from Lord Angelo by special charge.


CDLXXXIII - "EAUTYSDOOMANDD"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  The moist impediments unto my speech,
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
  Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
  Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
  All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?


CDLXXXIV - "ATEWHENICONSID"

  A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  With an invisible and subtle stealth
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  In the division of each several crime,
  Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.


CDLXXXV - "EREVERYTHINGTH"

  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
  This is a man's invention, and his hand.
  He's follow'd both with body and with mind;
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
  Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
  Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.


CDLXXXVI - "ATGROWSHOLDSIN"

  Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  One that made means to come by what he hath,
  Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
  Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Lady, you know no rules of charity,
  Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  In simple and low things to prince it much
  No glory lives behind the back of such.


CDLXXXVII - "PERFECTIONBUTA"

  Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
  That one for all, or all for one we gage;
  In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
  Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
  Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
  But by your setting on, by your consent?
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!


CDLXXXVIII - "LITTLEMOMENTTH"

  Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
  I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
  Tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
  To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  How many years a mortal man may live.


CDLXXXIX - "ATTHISHUGESTAG"

  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
  The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
  Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
  I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
  Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Since he himself is reft from her by death:
  That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
  And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
  Grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.


CDXC - "EPRESENTETHNOU"

  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  So under his insulting falchion lies
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
  Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!


CDXCI - "GHTBUTSHOWSWHE"

  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  So doth the cony struggle in the net.
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  O, is it so? But why commands the king
  What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
  See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
  When we were happy we had other names.
  Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


CDXCII - "REONTHESTARSIN"

  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
  Till that the nature of your fault be known
  He hath not money for these Irish wars,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
  The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  Against the laws and statutes of this town,
  Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
  She is a theme of honour and renown,
  It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.


CDXCIII - "SECRETINFLUENC"

  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
  I'll put a girdle round about the earth
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.


CDXCIV - "ECOMMENTWHENIP"

  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
  More than a wild exposture to each chance
  My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  That no supporter but the huge firm earth
  Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!
  He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  Poor we may call them in their native lords.


CDXCV - "ERCEIVETHATMEN"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  I see a yielding in the looks of France;
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
  His love, perceiving how he is enraged,
  And with a great heart heave away the storm:
  Than honesty to honesty engaged,
  Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?


CDXCVI - "ASPLANTSINCREA"

  All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
  Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  Comes through commissions, which compel from each
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.


CDXCVII - "SECHEEREDANDCH"

  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Come, come, you forward and unable worms!
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
  Disguise us at my lodging and return,
  Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.


CDXCVIII - "EQUEDEVENBYTHE"

  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
  Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
  His honesty rewards him in itself;
  Else would he never so demean himself.


CDXCIX - "SELFSAMESKYVAU"

  Scaling his present bearing with his past,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,
  She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
  And must we be divided? must we part?
  Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
  King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
  You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?


D - "NTINTHEIRYOUTH"

  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  To place upon the volume of your deeds,
  Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  That you should seal this lawless bloody book
  He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  I do believe her, though I know she lies,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!


DI - "FULSAPATHEIGHT"

  Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
  So many blows upon this face of mine,
  All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
  Places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
  And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
  That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
  His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?


DII - "DECREASEANDWEA"

  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  Strange images of death. As thick as hail
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
  Were I a common laugher, or did use
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Although not valued to the money's worth.


DIII - "RTHEIRBRAVESTA"

  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
  He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
  Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
  Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
  Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
  Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!


DIV - "TEOUTOFMEMORYT"

  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  Unto the king be by, and then his state
  To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
  O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
  For what they have not, that which they possess
  Many an English ditty lovely well
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  You shall be as a father to my youth;
  That we may know the traitors and the truth!


DV - "HENTHECONCEITO"

  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
  England and France might, through their amity,
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Here in your city; I now came from him:
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
  Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
  No; for he could not so resign his crown
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
  To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
  Of whom you seem to have so tender care?


DVI - "FTHISINCONSTAN"

  Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
  Turning past evils to advantages.
  His folly to the mettle of my speech?
  It is war's prize to take all vantages;
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  I am not I, if there be such an I;
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;
  Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
  And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?


DVII - "TSTAYSETSYOUMO"

  To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
  She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
  The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
  Since that the truest issue of thy throne
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  To whom my father is not all unknown,
  She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
  More than a wild exposture to each chance
  Of all his wars within the realm of France?


DVIII - "STRICHINYOUTHB"

  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Take that, until thou bring me better news.
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  In such a business give me leave to use
  Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
  His present and your pains we thank you for:
  If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
  Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.
  Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
  Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.


DIX - "EFOREMYSIGHTWH"

  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
  You must forget to be a woman; change
  She is a woman, therefore to be won.
  If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
  Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
  Happily met, my lady and my wife!
  Than all thy brothers; cherish it, my boy,
  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?


DX - "EREWASTEFULTIM"

  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
  And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
  Scaling his present bearing with his past,
  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.


DXI - "EDEBATETHWITHD"

  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  But my true love is grown to such excess
  And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
  The presentation of but what I was;
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
  I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
  To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.


DXII - "ECAYTOCHANGEYO"

  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
  And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
  Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
  The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  And in such indexes, although small pricks
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  You have received your griefs; nor are they such
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.


DXIII - "URDAYOFYOUTHTO"

  Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
  You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
  How many things by season season'd are
  Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
  Or else he never would compare between.


DXIV - "SULLIEDNIGHTAN"

  Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
  Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
  I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
  Now his important blood will nought deny
  In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
  The other, that he do record a gift,
  And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.


DXV - "DALLINWARWITHT"

  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  Let in that amity which you have made;
  Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
  I dare do all that may become a man;
  Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
  Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
  And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  His time of folly and his time of sport;
  To spoil the city and your royal court.


DXVI - "IMEFORLOVEOFYO"

  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  May they not be my oracles as well,
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
  O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?


DXVII - "UASHETAKESFROM"

  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
  Should many people, under two commands,
  He came too late, the ship was under sail:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  To visit other places; and come down
  As, to behold desert a beggar born,
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
  My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.


DXVIII - "YOUIENGRAFTYOU"

  You holy clergymen, is there no plot
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.
  Go, call before me all the lords in court.
  Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
  Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  You might have been enough the man you are,
  Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
  Unto the climate that they point upon.


DXIX - "NEWBUTWHEREFOR"

  Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
  But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
  He held me last night at least nine hours
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
  On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


DXX - "EDONOTYOUAMIGH"

  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
  O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
  You will demand of me why I do this?
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
  And the nobility of Rome are his:
  Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
  I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
  Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
  Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.


DXXI - "TIERWAYMAKEWAR"

  Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
  In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
  Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
  And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Who in this dull and long-continued truce
  And touching now the point of human skill,
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


DXXII - "UPONTHISBLOODY"

  Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
  Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
  On such a full sea are we now afloat;
  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
  Those that would die or ere resist are grown
  He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
  In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  But since correction lieth in those hands
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
  Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
  Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?


DXXIII - "TYRANTTIMEANDF"

  Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
  Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
  For womanish it is to be from thence.


DXXIV - "ORTIFYYOURSELF"

  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
  I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
  Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
  Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
  Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
  O, may such purple tears be alway shed
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.


DXXV - "INYOURDECAYWIT"

  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,
  Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Came from the north and thus it did import:
  Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
  You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
  When thou wast here above the ground, I was
  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.


DXXVI - "HMEANSMOREBLES"

  Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
  My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
  Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  By'r lady, he is a good musician.
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.


DXXVII - "SEDTHANMYBARRE"

  Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  And range with humble livers in content,
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  My mother is assailed in our tent,
  Yet let her be a principality,
  But if thy arms be to no other end,
  And death's dim look in life's mortality:
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


DXXVIII - "NRHYMENOWSTAND"

  No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  We shall be short in our provision:
  See you the fornicatress be removed:
  The harmony of this peace. The vision
  Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.


DXXIX - "YOUONTHETOPOFH"

  You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  O, but I love his lady too too much,
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
  He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
  For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


DXXX - "APPYHOURSANDMA"

  Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
  Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
  O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
  And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!


DXXXI - "NYMAIDENGARDEN"

  None else of name; and of all other men
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
  And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
  I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
  God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
  And I by this will be a gainer too;
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.


DXXXII - "SYETUNSETWITHV"

  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Show duty, as mistaken all this while
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
  When my love swears that she is made of truth
  I do not greatly care to be deceived,
  Their bodies to the lust of English youth
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


DXXXIII - "IRTUOUSWISHWOU"

  I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Or who should study to prefer a peace.
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  When these so noble benefits shall prove
  In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
  She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose
  How like the prodigal doth she return,
  Were I a common laugher, or did use
  On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
  Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.


DXXXIV - "LDBEARYOURLIVI"

  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  Beggar the estimation which you prized
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  O that it were to do! What have we done?
  Unto the body of a dismal yew,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
  In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  In brief, sir, study what you most affect.


DXXXV - "NGFLOWERSMUCHL"

  Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  For Brutus only overcame himself,
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  So that this land, like an offensive wife
  Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
  Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
  Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!


DXXXVI - "IKERTHANYOURPA"

  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  He calls me to a restitution large
  As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
  O, he is old and blushes not at death.
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.


DXXXVII - "INTEDCOUNTERFE"

  Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  To leave the city and commit yourself
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
  Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
  Or that or any place that harbours men.
  Until the golden circuit on my head,
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


DXXXVIII - "ITSOSHOULDTHEL"

  I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
  So long as out of limit and true rule
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
  He gains by death that hath such means to die:
  Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
  Upon the love and truth and vows which I
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  How he did seem to dive into their hearts
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.


DXXXIX - "INESOFLIFETHAT"

  I cannot tell what you and other men
  Not working with the eye without the ear,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  In having known no travel in his youth.
  For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  How and which way I may bestow myself
  And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!


DXL - "LIFEREPAIRWHIC"

  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  Is it not well? What should you need of more?
  Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
  It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
  He on her belly falls, she on her back.
  It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.


DXLI - "HTHISTIMESPENC"

  Had I it written, I would tear the word.
  To tread a measure with you on this grass.
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  It may be good: pride hath no other glass
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  I that do bring the news made not the match.
  My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  So is it not with me as with that Muse
  Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.


DXLII - "ILORMYPUPILPEN"

  I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
  You would have thought the very windows spake,
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
  I see, as in a map, the end of all.
  Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.


DXLIII - "NEITHERININWAR"

  No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
  Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
  Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
  I have been closely shrouded in this bush
  Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
  We'll put the matter to the present push.-
  As, if it can, I will presume in you--
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?


DXLIV - "DWORTHNOROUTWA"

  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
  Or have we eaten on the insane root
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
  Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
  No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
  On yon proud man, should take it off again
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
  This accident is not unlike my dream:
  What nearer debt in all humanity
  And yet not fall; so light is vanity.


DXLV - "RDFAIRCANMAKEY"

  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
  Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
  And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
  If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
  And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
  My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.


DXLVI - "OULIVEYOURSELF"

  Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
  Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
  Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
  I had forgot myself; am I not king?
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
  Of this great sport together, as you guess?
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
  For thy three thousand ducats here is six.


DXLVII - "INEYESOFMENTOG"

  I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  Or with the clamorous report of war
  For yet ere supper-time must I perform
  Merrily, merrily shall I live now
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Go I to make the French lay down their arms.


DXLVIII - "IVEAWAYYOURSEL"

  In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
  Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.


DXLIX - "FKEEPSYOURSELF"

  From his soft bosom never to remove,
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
  So am I now: O no, that cannot be;
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
  Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?


DL - "STILLANDYOUMUS"

  She would to each one sip. You are retired,
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
  I would his troubles likewise were expired,
  Limit each leader to his several charge,
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
  Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;
  Dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.


DLI - "TLIVEDRAWNBYYO"

  That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
  Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
  With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
  Never so much as in a thought unborn
  By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
  You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.


DLII - "UROWNSWEETSKIL"

  Upon so soft a subject as myself!
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
  Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
  Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  Who will not change a raven for a dove?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  To this unworthy husband of his wife;
  So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
  Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
  If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
  Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.


DLIII - "LWHOWILLBELIEV"

  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  Well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
  Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
  I know repentant tears ensue the deed,
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
  By which the world's best garden be achieved,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


DLIV - "EMYVERSEINTIME"

  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  She treads the path that she untreads again;
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  I know they are stuff'd with protestations
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
  It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
  Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


DLV - "TOCOMEIFITWERE"

  To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
  Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
  I would not my unhoused free condition
  Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.


DLVI - "FILLDWITHYOURM"

  France should have torn and rent my very heart,
  It shall do well. But yet do I believe
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  With those gross taunts I often have endured.
  I never heard a passion so confused,
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
  He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
  You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.


DLVII - "OSTHIGHDESERTS"

  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
  The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
  He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
  Is as the very centre of the earth,
  Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
  He that helps him take all my outward worth.
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
  The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
  So may a thousand actions, once afoot.


DLVIII - "THOUGHYETHEAVE"

  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
  Her ashes new create another heir,
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DLIX - "NKNOWSITISBUTA"

  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
  With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
  So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
  In argument and proof of which contract,
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  Before I would have granted to that act.
  Unless he live until he be a man.
  The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
  As I all other in all worths surmount.


DLX - "SATOMBWHICHHID"

  So shall I live to speak my father's words:
  A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
  By testament have given to the church
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
  Confine yourself but in a patient list.
  Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
  Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.


DLXI - "ESYOURLIFEANDS"

  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
  I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
  From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
  So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.


DLXII - "HOWSNOTHALFYOU"

  He held me last night at least nine hours
  Out of my lean and low ability
  With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
  Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
  You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
  Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.


DLXIII - "RPARTSIFICOULD"

  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
  Another, with his finger and his thumb,
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  The very list, the very utmost bound
  She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
  I have no relish of them, but abound
  For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
  In any breast of strong authority,
  Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!


DLXIV - "WRITETHEBEAUTY"

  We may not think the justness of each act
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  In argument and proof of which contract,
  To be of such a weak and silly mind
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  By doing deeds of hospitality.
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  And death's dim look in life's mortality:
  Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.


DLXV - "OFYOUREYESANDI"

  O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
  You love my son; invention is ashamed,
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  You are too young, too happy, and too good,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
  If any ship put out, then straight away.


DLXVI - "NFRESHNUMBERSN"

  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
  Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
  Before we hear him, of some things of weight
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?


DLXVII - "UMBERALLYOURGR"

  Unable to support this lump of clay,
  My will that marks thee for my earth's delight,
  Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
  Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
  Under the canopies of costly state,
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


DLXVIII - "ACESTHEAGETOCO"

  Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
  Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
  That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
  Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
  O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.


DLXIX - "MEWOULDSAYTHIS"

  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
  Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
  Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
  To take the one the other, by some chance,
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  I give to both your speeches, which were such
  Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?


DLXX - "POETLIESSUCHHE"

  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


DLXXI - "AVENLYTOUCHESN"

  As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
  To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
  Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;
  Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.


DLXXII - "EERTOUCHDEARTH"

  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  And, after, meet you sooner than you would.
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  This news is mortal to the queen: look down
  Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.


DLXXIII - "LYFACESSOSHOUL"

  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Show duty, as mistaken all this while
  See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
  Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
  Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
  Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
  Of fourteen; I have known thee already.
  Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
  Live scandalized and foully spoken of.


DLXXIV - "DMYPAPERSYELLO"

  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
  Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?


DLXXV - "WDWITHTHEIRAGE"

  Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
  With amplest entertainment: my free drift
  I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen
  Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  That Edward is escaped from your brother,
  He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  I am left out; for me nothing remains.
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
  God forbid any malice should prevail,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


DLXXVI - "BESCORNDLIKEOL"

  By strangling thee in her accursed womb
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
  Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  Do the part of an honest man in it.
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  In whose comparison all whites are ink,
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!


DLXXVII - "DMENOFLESSTRUT"

  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  May all the building in my fancy pluck
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  The basin that receives your guilty blood.


DLXXVIII - "HTHANTONGUEAND"

  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  And let Bianca take her sister's room.
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
  Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.


DLXXIX - "YOURTRUERIGHTS"

  You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
  Observe degree, priority and place,
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Upon the love and truth and vows which I
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
  Gave me my being and my father first,
  How much in duty I am bound to both.
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
  Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?


DLXXX - "BETERMDAPOETSR"

  Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  To-morrow shall we visit you again.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
  Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
  Are at the duke's already: you have been
  Past all expressing. It is very meet
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
  Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


DLXXXI - "AGEANDSTRETCHE"

  As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Able to ravish any dull conceit:
  Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
  Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Then let your will attend on their accords.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
  Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.


DLXXXII - "DMETREOFANANTI"

  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
  And underwrite in an observing kind
  Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
  And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
  Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
  I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.


DLXXXIII - "QUESONGBUTWERE"

  Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.
  O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Give entertainment to the might of it,
  By them shall make a fuller number up,
  Upon the dancing banners of the French,
  The winds and persecutions of the sky.
  Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


DLXXXIV - "SOMECHILDOFYOU"

  Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
  Or your own honour to contain the ring,
  My hands are of your colour; but I shame
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
  Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
  If ever he have wife, let her he made
  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  For he himself is subject to his birth.
  Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.


DLXXXV - "RSALIVETHATTIM"

  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
  Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
  Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Thy word is current with him for my death,
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
  And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
  To business with the King, more than the scope
  To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
  If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole
  More than my body's parting with my soul!


DLXXXVI - "EYOUSHOULDLIVE"

  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


DLXXXVII - "TWICEINITANDIN"

  The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
  Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Is now in England, ransacking the church,
  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
  And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  I did so, and went further, which is now
  Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.


DLXXXVIII - "MYRHYMESHALLIC"

  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
  Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
  And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  Like witless antics, one another meet,
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.


DLXXXIX - "OMPARETHEETOAS"

  O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
  May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
  And yet the king not privy to my drift,
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?


DXC - "UMMERSDAYTHOUA"

  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
  Most bitterly on you, as putter on
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  So that this land, like an offensive wife
  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  And all those twenty could but kill one life.
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  To be so tickled, they would change their state
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  And he to yours, and all of you to God's!


DXCI - "RTMORELOVELYAN"

  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  To stay him from the fall of vanity:
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  And ring these fingers with thy household worms
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.


DXCII - "DMORETEMPERATE"

  Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
  Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
  Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
  The fishermen that walk upon the beach
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


DXCIII - "ROUGHWINDSDOSH"

  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  She would not lose it: her attendants are
  Did he not, contrary to form of law,
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!


DXCIV - "AKETHEDARLINGB"

  As little is the wisdom, where the flight
  Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  The presentation of but what I was;
  He that helps him take all my outward worth.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
  Robs me of that which not enriches him
  Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  By most mechanical and dirty hand.


DXCV - "UDSOFMAYANDSUM"

  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
  My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Driving back shadows over louring hills:
  She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Most just and heavy causes make oppose.


DXCVI - "MERSLEASEHATHA"

  My true preserver, and a loyal sir
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  And speaks not to himself but with a pride
  Summon their general unto the wall.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  A saucy stranger in his court to mart
  That taught his son the office of a fowl!
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  And I am ready to put armour on.


DXCVII - "LLTOOSHORTADAT"

  Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
  Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
  To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
  Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
  Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  Have hent the gates, and very near upon
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
  That at his will he may do danger with.
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.


DXCVIII - "ESOMETIMETOOHO"

  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.
  I fear there will a worse come in his place.
  Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  There let them bide until we have devised
  Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
  Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
  How light and portable my pain seems now,
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?


DXCIX - "TTHEEYEOFHEAVE"

  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  The vigour and the picture of my youth:
  Have you importuned him by any means?
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  Exceed account; but the full sum of me
  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  For some displeasing service I have done,
  He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  And of the season too, it shall appear.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DC - "NSHINESANDOFTE"

  Not Erebus itself were dim enough
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
  As he made semblance of his duty, would
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
  The very principals did seem to rend,
  Either of you to be the other's end.


DCI - "NISHISGOLDCOMP"

  Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
  If I would yield him my virginity,
  Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
  Hear him but reason in divinity,
  I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
  Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
  Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
  Doing the execution and the act
  Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  My strength can give you: then no more remains,
  Perchance you think too much of so much pains?


DCII - "LEXIONDIMMDAND"

  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
 eXcels whatever yet you look'd upon
  If thy offences were upon record,
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
  I had my father's signet in my purse,
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
  Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
  Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
  As strange unto your town as to your talk;
  Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!


DCIII - "EVERYFAIRFROMF"

  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
  Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
  For ever and for ever shall be yours.


DCIV - "AIRSOMETIMEDEC"

  Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  O, with what wings shall his affections fly
  Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  I do remember in this shepherd boy
  My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.


DCV - "LINESBYCHANCEO"

  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  In her consists my happiness and thine;
  Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
  But not intentively: I did consent,
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  And the nobility of Rome are his:
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.


DCVI - "RNATURESCHANGI"

  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.
  Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
  Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
  As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself
  I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.


DCVII - "NGCOURSEUNTRIM"

  Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
  Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
  Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  I do not without danger walk these streets:
  My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!


DCVIII - "MDBUTTHYETERNA"

  May one, that is a herald and a prince,
  Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
  But not without that harmful stroke which since
  Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
  That we may bring you something on the way.
  The people know it; and have now received
  Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
  You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  No, no, I am but shadow of myself:
  And so your follies fight against yourself.


DCIX - "LSUMMERSHALLNO"

  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
  No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.


DCX - "TFADENORLOSEPO"

  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
  Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?


DCXI - "SSESSIONOFTHAT"

  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
  Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
  Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
  Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
  For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
  To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
  To trouble and disturb the king and us?


DCXII - "FAIRTHOUOWESTN"

  From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
  And every one shall share i' the gains;
  If with the sap of reason you would quench,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  To be your comforter when he is gone.
  Had you a special warrant for the deed?
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
  Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
  With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,
  Nothing, unless you render her again.


DCXIII - "ORSHALLDEATHBR"

  O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Shall win the wager which we will propose.
  How often said, my dignity would last
  A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  Let fair humanity abhor the deed
  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
  This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  Back: call you that backing of your friends? A
  Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.


DCXIV - "AGTHOUWANDERST"

  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
  Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  His wonders and his praises do contend
  O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
  Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
  When creeping murmur and the poring dark
  And still, as you are weary of the weight,
  Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
  Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.


DCXV - "INHISSHADEWHEN"

  I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
  Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
  Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
  Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.


DCXVI - "INETERNALLINES"

  I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
  Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That is the way to lay the city flat;
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  No object but her passion's strength renews;
  And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
  Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
  I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
  No, not so much perdition as an hair
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.


DCXVII - "TOTIMETHOUGROW"

  Try what repentance can. What can it not?
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
  If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  May be put from her by society:
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Have broken with the king; who hath so far
  O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!


DCXVIII - "ESTSOLONGASMEN"

  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
  That is too much presumption on thy part:
  So two, together weeping, make one woe.
  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  Give me the letter; I will look on it.
  A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
  She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
  My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


DCXIX - "CANBREATHEOREY"

  Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
  And not of any challenge of desert,
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  All which we pine for now: and this report
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.


DCXX - "ESCANSEESOLONG"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
  Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
  Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
  No more can I be sever'd from your side,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
  Of that great shadow I did represent;
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.


DCXXI - "LIVESTHISANDTH"

  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  The kiss you take is better than you give;
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  I'll send them all as willing as I live:
  Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
  And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  Distract your army, which doth most consist
  Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
  Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?


DCXXII - "ISGIVESLIFETOT"

  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  For you have show'd me that which well approves
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
  Out of my lean and low ability
  That proof is call'd impossibility.


DCXXIII - "HEEDEVOURINGTI"

  Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Unless the master were the man. How now!
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
  I knowing all my peril, thou no art.


DCXXIV - "MEBLUNTTHOUTHE"

  My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
  Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
  Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
  Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
  His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Upon the moment did her force subdue,
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.


DCXXV - "LIONSPAWSANDMA"

  Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
  I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
  Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
  Procure me music ready when he wakes,
  A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
  Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
  Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your
  And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
  And learn to make a body of a limb.


DCXXVI - "KETHEEARTHDEVO"

  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  They crave to be demanded. Who is this
  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
  However, but a folly bought with wit,
  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!


DCXXVII - "URHEROWNSWEETB"

  Upon his royal face there is no note
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
  Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
  Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
  She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
  Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  The enemy more mighty than he seems:
  By so much is the wonder in extremes.


DCXXVIII - "ROODPLUCKTHEKE"

  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
  Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
  Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
  Upon the dancing banners of the French,
  Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
  Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


DCXXIX - "ENTEETHFROMTHE"

  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  That mothers shall but smile when they behold
  His meaning struck her ere his words begun.
  For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
  Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
  Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


DCXXX - "FIERCETIGERSJA"

  For I am almost ready to dissolve,
  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  The blood of English shall manure the ground,
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
  And seal the title with a lovely kiss!


DCXXXI - "WSANDBURNTHELO"

  Would it be better, madam, than I am?
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.


DCXXXII - "NGLIVEDPHOENIX"

  Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
  If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
  He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  In private will I talk with thee apart.
 eXposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


DCXXXIII - "INHERBLOODMAKE"

  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
  Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  More composition and fierce quality
  Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
  Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


DCXXXIV - "GLADANDSORRYSE"

  Gave me my being and my father first,
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;
  Of a glad father compass thee about!
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
  England is safe, if true within itself?


DCXXXV - "ASONSASTHOUFLE"

  Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Of such contents as you will wonder at;
  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
  So much applauded through the realm of France?
  As matching to his youth and vanity,
  Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
  That I should seem to lack humanity
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  Out, devil! I remember them too well:
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


DCXXXVI - "ETSANDDOWHATEE"

  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
  So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
  And happily may your sweet self put on
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
  What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  Are of imagination all compact:
  To banish your defenders; till at length
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


DCXXXVII - "RTHOUWILTSWIFT"

  Real necessities, and give way the while
  To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
  He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
  The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  For this affliction has a taste as sweet
  Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.


DCXXXVIII - "FOOTEDTIMETOTH"

  First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  To stay him from the fall of vanity:
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Doth any name particular belong
  To see how fortune is disposed to us;
  In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
  More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
  Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.


DCXXXIX - "EWIDEWORLDANDA"

  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  And threat me I shall never come to bliss
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.


DCXL - "LLHERFADINGSWE"

  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
  As touching France, to give a greater sum
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
  Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
  Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


DCXLI - "ETSBUTIFORBIDT"

  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  The book of his good acts, whence men have read
  So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
  Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
  I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
  For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
  Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  By such invention as I can devise?
  I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  The fear of that withholds my present aid.


DCXLII - "HEEONEMOSTHEIN"

  How! my good name? or to report of you
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Or not remember what I must be now!
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Morning for France. The duke hath offered him
  Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.
  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
  That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  I wonder now how yonder city stands
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.


DCXLIII - "OUSCRIMEOCARVE"

  O, had they in that darksome prison died!
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,
  Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  It shall appear that your demands are just,
  Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.


DCXLIV - "NOTWITHTHYHOUR"

  No better than the earth he lies upon,
  O Antony, beg not your death of us.
  To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
  Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
  I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
  The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
  He sends you this most memorable line,
  To make me hunger more; that I should forge
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
  Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


DCXLV - "SMYLOVESFAIRBR"

  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
  Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
  From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
  And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
  It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  By'r lady, he is a good musician.
  Remember so weak a composition.


DCXLVI - "OWNORDRAWNOLIN"

  Of this escape and whither they are bound;
  Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
  No man so potent breathes upon the ground
  Or in my life what comfort, when I am
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
  Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  If you did know for whom I gave the ring
  Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.


DCXLVII - "ESTHEREWITHTHI"

  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
  Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
  In number more than ever women spoke,
  Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
  Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  It is too heavy for so light a tune.


DCXLVIII - "NEANTIQUEPENHI"

  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  As, to behold desert a beggar born,
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
  I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
  Question enrages him. At once, good night:
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  He hath a garden circummured with brick,
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.


DCXLIX - "MINTHYCOURSEUN"

  My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  He sought to murder: but her better stars
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Come, let us go: we will include all jars
  Or, being open, put into his hands
  Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Such civil war is in my love and hate
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Upon the water as he'll stand and read
  Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.


DCL - "TAINTEDDOALLOW"

  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Through all the signories it was the first
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  And with a larger tether may he walk
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!


DCLI - "FORBEAUTYSPATT"

  Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
  Or else what lets it but he would be here?
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
  Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
  Suspect I may, but not directly tell;
  Past all expressing. It is very meet
  Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.


DCLII - "ERNTOSUCCEEDIN"

  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
  Of estimation and command in arms.
  Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  Came short of composition, but in chief
  Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  If half thy outward graces had been placed
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.


DCLIII - "GMENYETDOTHYWO"

  Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
  My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  O, thou wilt be a wilderness again.
  The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
  Have I once lived to see two honest men?
  Yet, for necessity of present life,
  What watchful cares do interpose themselves
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


DCLIV - "RSTOLDTIMEDESP"

  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
  O, had the monster seen those lily hands
  Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  The lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
  I never heard a passion so confused,
  Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Did give him that same royalty he wears;
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
  Poor lady, she were better love a dream.


DCLV - "ITETHYWRONGMYL"

  If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
  You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
  We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!


DCLVI - "OVESHALLINMYVE"

  O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
  He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  If you bethink yourself of any crime
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


DCLVII - "RSEEVERLIVEYOU"

  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
  I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.


DCLVIII - "NGAWOMANSFACEW"

  Now thou and I are new in amity,
  Go you before, and I will follow you.
  And thou art wedded to calamity.
  What you command, that rests in me to do.
  O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
  Most like a noble lord in love and one
  And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
  Catching all passions in his craft of will:
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Whose glory fills the world with loud report.


DCLIX - "ITHNATURESOWNH"

  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
  Have I since your departure had, my lords.
  Not knowing them until we know their grave:
  And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
  Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
  Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.


DCLX - "ANDPAINTEDHAST"

  A dedicated beggar to the air,
  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
  That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.


DCLXI - "THOUTHEMASTERM"

  This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
  His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
  And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
  Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
  Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Making another head to fight again.


DCLXII - "ISTRESSOFMYPAS"

  I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  So he were like him and by Venus' side.
  Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
  O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
  More upon humour than advised respect.
  Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
  Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
  And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
  Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.


DCLXIII - "SIONAWOMANSGEN"

  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
  On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
  Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
  O, some authority how to proceed;
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
  And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.


DCLXIV - "TLEHEARTBUTNOT"

  Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  Let him have all the rigor of the law.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Between whose endless jar justice resides,
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  There is expectance here from both the sides,
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.


DCLXV - "ACQUAINTEDWITH"

  As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
  Cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
  Question enrages him. At once, good night:
  Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
  No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
  Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,
  If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
  Their face their manners most expressly told:
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


DCLXVI - "SHIFTINGCHANGE"

  Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  His mother was a witch, and one so strong
  If half thy outward graces had been placed
  For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
  To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
  In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
  Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
  He kisses her; and she, by her good will,
  And then comes answer like an Absey book:
  Not changing heart with habit, I am still
  Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


DCLXVII - "ASISFALSEWOMEN"

  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
  See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
  O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
  My love with words and errors still she feeds;
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.


DCLXVIII - "SFASHIONANEYEM"

  Start not; her actions shall be holy as
  Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
  And, like her true nobility, she has
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
  O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
  Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Your French heart, I will be glad to hear you
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.


DCLXIX - "OREBRIGHTTHANT"

  Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  But she's best married that dies married young.
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Immortal longings in me: now no more
  God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
  Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  He shall be executed presently.
  And, of so great a favour growing proud,
  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!


DCLXX - "HEIRSLESSFALSE"

  He speaks not like a man of God's making.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  So much I challenge that I may profess
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


DCLXXI - "INROLLINGGILDI"

  I'd set my ten commandments in your face.
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Let me be blest to make this happy close;
  Love can transpose to form and dignity:
  I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
  Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.


DCLXXII - "NGTHEOBJECTWHE"

  Not measuring what use we made of them.
  Gelding the opposed continent as much
  Then think you right: I am not what I am.
  Honour and virtue and conversed with such
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
  Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Cool and congeal again to what it was.
  Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
  When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
  Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


DCLXXIII - "REUPONITGAZETH"

  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  To drink small beer: all the realm shall be in
  Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
  As mine, against their will. Should all despair
  Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
  Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.


DCLXXIV - "AMANINHUEALLHU"

  As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
  Myself against the level of mine aim;
  And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
  No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
  In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  And free access and favour as the rest.
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
  Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
  Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
  Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.


DCLXXV - "ESINHISCONTROL"

  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
  Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.


DCLXXVI - "LINGMUCHSTEALS"

  Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
  I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
  No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
  Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  After so long grief, such festivity!
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!


DCLXXVII - "MENSEYESANDWOM"

  Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  So I return rebuked to my content
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  And I will give a taste of it forthwith
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  Deal with poison; I will possess him with
  Were it not pity that this goodly boy
  Or lain in ambush to betray my life,
  My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.


DCLXXVIII - "ENSSOULSAMAZET"

  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
  Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
  Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.


DCLXXIX - "HANDFORAWOMANW"

  Here overcome, as one full of despair,
  An if you do, you will but make it blush
  No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
  Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
  From whence you have them. You are jealous now
  Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  And do so, love; yet when they have devised
  With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
  And I will set this foot of mine as far
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  We cannot feel too little, hear too much.


DCLXXX - "ERTTHOUFIRSTCR"

  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
  This petty brabble will undo us all.
  He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
  For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
  If that the devil and mischance look big
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
  The noble Percy slain, and all his men
  Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


DCLXXXI - "EATEDTILLNATUR"

  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  A little month, or ere those shoes were old
  That treason can but peep to what it would,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
  Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  And with his former title greet Macbeth.
  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!


DCLXXXII - "EASSHEWROUGHTT"

  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  And the nobility of Rome are his:
  So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
  She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  To be her men and wear her livery:
  That he would labour my delivery.


DCLXXXIII - "HEEFELLADOTING"

  He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  Delivers in such apt and gracious words
  Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  In least speak most, to my capacity.
  Nor never did my actions yet commence
  Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!


DCLXXXIV - "ANDBYADDITIONM"

  A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
  Deservedly confined into this rock,
  Before we hear him, of some things of weight
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
  In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  It cannot be; some villains of my court
  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
  No; for he could not so resign his crown
  Master, some show to welcome us to town.


DCLXXXV - "EOFTHEEDEFEATE"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
  From a resolved and honourable war,
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  Has done no more than other knights have done;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
  The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


DCLXXXVI - "DBYADDINGONETH"

  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
  Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:
  And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
  I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
  Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
  Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
  How use doth breed a habit in a man!


DCLXXXVII - "INGTOMYPURPOSE"

  I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
  You shall be more beloving than beloved.
  Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


DCLXXXVIII - "NOTHINGBUTSINC"

  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
  In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
  Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
  Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
  I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.


DCLXXXIX - "ESHEPRICKDTHEE"

  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  The like do you; so shall we pass along,
  He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


DCXC - "OUTFORWOMENSPL"

  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
  Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
  For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
  Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  With letters of your love to her at large.
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
  My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Never to England shall he bear his life;
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


DCXCI - "EASUREMINEBETH"

  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  I put myself to thy direction, and
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  But little stars may hide them when they list.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
  Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.


DCXCII - "YLOVEANDTHYLOV"

  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  And I will have you and that fault withal;
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
  Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
  He is complete in feature and in mind
  You shall not be admitted to his sight.
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


DCXCIII - "ESUSETHEIRTREA"

  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
  Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.


DCXCIV - "SURESOISITNOTW"

  So many days my ewes have been with young;
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
  O, what authority and show of truth
  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
  I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
  That they lost France and made his England bleed:
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
  Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?


DCXCV - "ITHMEASWITHTHA"

  In having much, torments us with defect
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  He holds your temper in a high respect
  My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
  Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
  Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
  Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!


DCXCVI - "TMUSESTIRRDBYA"

  This house, these servants and this same myself
  My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
  Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  Than as your honour and as your renown,
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Drew to defend him when he was beset:
  Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.


DCXCVII - "PAINTEDBEAUTYT"

  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
  An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
  I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
  Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  To clear this spot by death, at least I give
  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  That which so often you did bid me steal.


DCXCVIII - "OHISVERSEWHOHE"

  Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  Whither away, or where is thy abode?
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  How and which way I may bestow myself
  England is safe, if true within itself?


DCXCIX - "AVENITSELFFORO"

  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
  I gave it freely ever; and there's none
  Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart
  So early walking did I see your son:
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
  For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
  For what I will, I will, and there an end.
  Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?


DCC - "RNAMENTDOTHUSE"

  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  And, madam, at your father's castle walls
  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
  Then go with me to make the matter good.
  Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
  The treasury of everlasting joy.
  How many women saw this child of his?
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DCCI - "ANDEVERYFAIRWI"

  As jewels purchased at an easy price;
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
  And his enforcement of the city wives;
  It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
  In having known no travel in his youth.


DCCII - "THHISFAIRDOTHR"

  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
  I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
  And consequently thy rude hand to act
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
  O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.


DCCIII - "EHEARSEMAKINGA"

  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  How he her chamber-window will ascend
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  And where I did begin, there shall I end;
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  So much I challenge that I may profess
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
  And punish them to your height of pleasure.
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
  Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!


DCCIV - "COUPLEMENTOFPR"

  Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
  On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
  Like softest music to attending ears!
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  My gracious prince, and honourable peers,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  None wed the second but who killed the first.
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
  Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


DCCV - "OUDCOMPAREWITH"

  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
  Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
  Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
  How does my old acquaintance of this isle?


DCCVI - "SUNANDMOONWITH"

  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  O Cressida! but that the busy day,
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Within these three days let me hear thee say
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
  Here therefore for a while I will remain.


DCCVII - "EARTHANDSEASRI"

  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  And that which would appear offence in us,
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  There's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  A woman, naturally born to fears;
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
  Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
  Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
  Either to get the town again or die:
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  Save something too much wonder of his eye,
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  It is to jet upon a prince's right?


DCCVIII - "CHGEMSWITHAPRI"

  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
  Say what I think of it, since I have found
  When well-apparell'd April on the heel
  In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
  The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
  He entertain'd a show so seeming just,
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  I should fight withal, if he be alive.


DCCIX - "LSFIRSTBORNFLO"

  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
  For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
  I will be squared by this. I do believe
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  The liker you; few taller are so young.
  But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
  For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.


DCCX - "WERSANDALLTHIN"

  We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
  And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
  Never, before this day, in all his life.
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,
  Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Hop forty paces through the public street;
  I'll call him presently, my noble lord.
  Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.


DCCXI - "GSRARETHATHEAV"

  Garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
  Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  And I will do it without fear or doubt,
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  The pretty follies that themselves commit;
  Have hent the gates, and very near upon
  As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
  Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


DCCXII - "ENSAIRINTHISHU"

  England, impatient of your just demands,
  No better than the earth he lies upon,
  Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
  Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
  If to have done the thing you gave in charge
  Robs me of that which not enriches him
  I long to know the truth hereof at large.
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  If in which time expired, he not return,
  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
  His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
  Until the queen his mistress bury it.


DCCXIII - "GERONDUREHEMSO"

  Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.
  Out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.


DCCXIV - "LETMETRUEINLOV"

  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.
  Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  The noble Percy slain, and all his men
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Upon whose age we void it up again,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
  No more infected with my country's love
  Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


DCCXV - "EBUTTRULYWRITE"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  But they will quake and tremble all this day.
  Unto your Grace do I in chief address
  The view of earthly glory: men might say,
  The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
  Yes, if this present quality of war-
  Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  It did me good, before the palace gate
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.


DCCXVI - "ANDTHENBELIEVE"

  Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
  Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  That dying fear through all her body spread;
  Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
  If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DCCXVII - "MEMYLOVEISASFA"

  My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  My advocation is not now in tune;
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
  Save that there was not time enough to hear,
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;
  For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
  And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!


DCCXVIII - "IRASANYMOTHERS"

  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
  Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
  And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
  Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
  To no apparent likelihood of breach,
  He hath a person and a smooth dispose
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?


DCCXIX - "CHILDTHOUGHNOT"

  Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  If that your moody discontented souls
  Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
  Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
  That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
  Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  That not your trespass but my madness speaks.


DCCXX - "SOBRIGHTASTHOS"

  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
  By this brave duke came early to his grave:
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  If any in Vienna be of worth
  Gelding the opposed continent as much
  His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
  The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
  And answer me declined, sword against sword,
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  The purest treasure mortal times afford
  How would it fare with your departed souls?
  One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
  Stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.


DCCXXI - "EGOLDCANDLESFI"

  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.
  And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
  Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
  Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
  From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
  I do assure thee, father, so it is.


DCCXXII - "XDINHEAVENSAIR"

 eXcusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  I see thy glory like a shooting star
  No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
  I know you are more clement than vile men,
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!


DCCXXIII - "LETTHEMSAYMORE"

  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  The image of a wicked heinous fault
  To recreate himself when he hath sung,
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  Say they be fled; Germans are honest men.
  And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
  You have great reason to do Richard right;
  Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
  Of their disguising and pretended flight;
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


DCCXXIV - "THANLIKEOFHEAR"

  Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
  An if my father please, I am content.
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  If on my credit you dare build so far
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  An onion will do well for such a shift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


DCCXXV - "SAYWELLIWILLNO"

  See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
  And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
  Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
  Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
  What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!


DCCXXVI - "TPRAISETHATPUR"

  There should be found such false dissembling guile?
  Particularities and petty sounds
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  Into a great estate: when he was poor,
  See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  And say you would present her at the leet,
  They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
  Past all expressing. It is very meet
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


DCCXXVII - "POSENOTTOSELLM"

  Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
  That is my office, for my father's sake.
  That one for all, or all for one we gage;
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Many will swoon when they do look on blood.


DCCXXVIII - "YGLASSSHALLNOT"

  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
  Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
  And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
  Some one be ready with a costly suit,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
  Her beauty and the value of her dower,
  And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
  Love can transpose to form and dignity:
  Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
  The boy gives warning something doth approach.


DCCXXIX - "PERSUADEMEIAMO"

  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  Under what colour he commits this ill.
  As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
  Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  In this the antique and well noted face
  And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
  Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
  Or overthrow incurable ensues.


DCCXXX - "LDSOLONGASYOUT"

  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Only to flatter fools and make them bold:
  Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
  Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
  And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
  Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
  One that made means to come by what he hath,
  Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
  The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?


DCCXXXI - "HANDTHOUAREOFO"

  Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?


DCCXXXII - "NEDATEBUTWHENI"

  Not three hours' travel from this very place.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
  And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
  The means of weakness and debility;
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
  Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
  With hope to find the like event in love,
  Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.


DCCXXXIII - "NTHEETIMESFURR"

  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  This is some token from a newer friend:
  Have you not made an universal shout,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
  I will not bandy with thee word for word,
  My resolution, husband, do thou take;
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
  From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


DCCXXXIV - "OWSIBEHOLDTHEN"

  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  Whose nature is so far from doing harms
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  I crave the benefit of law of arms.
  But then renew I could not, like the moon;
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Or your own honour to contain the ring,
  Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
  Devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.


DCCXXXV - "LOOKIDEATHMYDA"

  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
  I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
  Did he not, contrary to form of law,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!
  That he would labour my delivery.
  How have I been behaved, that he might stick
  My lodging out. Give him a livery
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  At your request a little from himself.


DCCXXXVI - "YSSHOULDEXPIAT"

  Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
  How he did seem to dive into their hearts
  O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
 eXcept it be to pray against thy foes.
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  It shall become thee well to act my woes;
  And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
  Things past redress are now with me past care.


DCCXXXVII - "EFORALLTHATBEA"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Against my love shall be, as I am now,
  Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
  As long a term as yet we have to live,
  There is no vice so simple but assumes
  But to the earth some special good doth give,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  And golden times, and happy news of price.


DCCXXXVIII - "UTYTHATDOTHCOV"

  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
  You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
  To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
  How like the empress and her sons you are!
  And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
  Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
  The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


DCCXXXIX - "ERTHEEISBUTTHE"

  Even for this let us divided live,
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  To whom this wreath of victory I give,
  Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
  She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
  But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
  Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.
  Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


DCCXL - "SEEMLYRAIMENTO"

  Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  A mark so bloody on the business, but
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  No reason I, since of your lives you set
  The poor fool prays her that he may depart:
  O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!


DCCXLI - "FMYHEARTWHICHI"

  For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
  Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
  His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
  Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.


DCCXLII - "NTHYBREASTDOTH"

  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  To link my dear friend to a common stale.
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  You love the breeder better than the male.
  Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  And what love can do that dares love attempt;
  See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,
  The fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Of any true decision. Nature craves
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!


DCCXLIII - "LIVEASTHINEINM"

  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
  How he did seem to dive into their hearts
  It is religion to be thus forsworn,
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  I am a soldier and now bound to France.
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


DCCXLIV - "EHOWCANITHENBE"

  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  He take leave, and presently after him.
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
  And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
  Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
  I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
  To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
  How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


DCCXLV - "ELDERTHANTHOUA"

  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
  Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
  Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
  O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
  Until it wither with me to my grave
  And gives them what he will, not what they crave.


DCCXLVI - "RTOTHEREFORELO"

  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
  Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  O young and noble Cato, art thou down?


DCCXLVII - "VEBEOFTHYSELFS"

  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  By how much better than my word I am,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
  Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
  So many guests invite as here are writ.


DCCXLVIII - "OWARYASINOTFOR"

  O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
  When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  Your brother and his lover have embraced:
  Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;
  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
  To make me slave to it; and for your sake
  Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
  Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


DCCXLIX - "MYSELFBUTFORTH"

  My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
  For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
  By whose approach the regions of Artois,
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
  For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
  He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.


DCCL - "EEWILLBEARINGT"

  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
  Recall not what we give, and therein may
  I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
  Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?
  Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
  Though you are old enough to be my heir.


DCCLI - "HYHEARTWHICHIW"

  Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
  Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  And all things change them to the contrary.
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
  What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  I have, and most unwillingly, of late
  Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
  His promises fly so beyond his state
  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  Why do you speak so startingly and rash?


DCCLII - "ILLKEEPSOCHARY"

  I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
  Sticking together in calamity.
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.


DCCLIII - "ASTENDERNURSEH"

  An appetite that I am sick withal,
  Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt'red stray.
  Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!


DCCLIV - "ERBABEFROMFARI"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
  And, dying, mention it within their wills,
  But mine is made the prologue to their play;
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
  My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
  For such disguise as haply shall become
  And on it said a century of prayers,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?


DCCLV - "NGILLPRESUMENO"

  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
  Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
  Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  May you be happy in your wish, my lord
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.


DCCLVI - "TONTHYHEARTWHE"

  To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  You may partake of any thing we say:
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Things past redress are now with me past care.
  Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


DCCLVII - "NMINEISSLAINTH"

  Now entertain conjecture of a time
  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  If you bethink yourself of any crime
  Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  In the most terrible and nimble stroke
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Like softest music to attending ears!
  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
  Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
  That this my mother's son was none of his;
  He is no less than what we say he is.


DCCLVIII - "OUGAVESTMETHIN"

  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  And, from the place where you behold us now,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Such as will enter at a lady's ear
  To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
  May be put from her by society:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
  If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
  Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.


DCCLIX - "ENOTTOGIVEBACK"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
  The people know it; and have now received
  Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  It would not out at windows nor at doors.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Each day still better other's happiness;
  But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!
  Coming and going with thy honey breath.
  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.


DCCLX - "AGAINASANUNPER"

  Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
  It is religion to be thus forsworn,
  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
  So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
  As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


DCCLXI - "FECTACTORONTHE"

  For yet ere supper-time must I perform
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Can no way change you to a milder form,
  Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
  And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
  Come from the north; and as I came along
  To have her back return'd: thus to persist
  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
  He would have well becomed this place, and graced
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


DCCLXII - "STAGEWHOWITHHI"

  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
  And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
  Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
  Here at more leisure may your Highness read,
  Or on Diana's altar to protest
  Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
  I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  I did present him with the Paris balls.


DCCLXIII - "SFEARISPUTBESI"

  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
  For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And then is heard no more: it is a tale
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
  Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
  Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  This is my king, York, I do not mistake;
  But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.


DCCLXIV - "DESHISPARTORSO"

  Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
  How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
  A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
  O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
  Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!


DCCLXV - "MEFIERCETHINGR"

  Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
  I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


DCCLXVI - "EPLETEWITHTOOM"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Partly that I have need of such a youth
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
  I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
  That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
  He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
  The discontents repair, and men's reports
  Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
  Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
  My grave is like to be my wedding bed.


DCCLXVII - "UCHRAGEWHOSEST"

  Unto the brother of your loving bride;
  Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
  Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
  Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
  He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  Of what a monarchy you are the head:
  Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.


DCCLXVIII - "RENGTHSABUNDAN"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
  Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
  The dedicated words which writers use
  His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
  And my pretext to strike at him admits
  By holy human law, and common troth,
  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
  Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.


DCCLXIX - "CEWEAKENSHISOW"

  Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  We still have judgment here; that we but teach
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  A most unspotted lily shall she pass
  Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
  He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
  I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
  Othello, leave some officer behind,
  While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.


DCCLXX - "NHEARTSOIFORFE"

  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;
  Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
  On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  For what offence have I this fortnight been
  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.


DCCLXXI - "AROFTRUSTFORGE"

  Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  Thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
  For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
  O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
  Else would he never so demean himself.


DCCLXXII - "TTOSAYTHEPERFE"

  Then, England's messenger, return in post,
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  And over-joy of heart doth minister.
  Yet let her be a principality,
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  Here on my knee I beg mortality,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
  Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


DCCLXXIII - "CTCEREMONYOFLO"

  Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
  To business with the King, more than the scope
  Come not within these doors; within this roof
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  Only to flatter fools and make them bold:
  Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
  Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.


DCCLXXIV - "VESRITEANDINMI"

  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  I have been in such a pickle since I
  To make yourself a son out of my blood.
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
  Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
  I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.


DCCLXXV - "NEOWNLOVESSTRE"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Or who should study to prefer a peace.
  Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
  Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
  This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DCCLXXVI - "NGTHSEEMTODECA"

  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
  Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
  The king and his companions: warily
  Other offenders we will pause upon.
  Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.


DCCLXXVII - "YOERCHARGEDWIT"

  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
  Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
  And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Did come to his hands, and commands shall be
  Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  Importing the surrender of those lands
  To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.


DCCLXXVIII - "HBURDENOFMINEO"

  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
  Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
  If ever you have look'd on better days,
  Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.


DCCLXXIX - "WNLOVESMIGHTOL"

  We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
  Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
  More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,
  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  The enemy, marching along by them,
  Of present death, and shame that might ensue
  Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.


DCCLXXX - "ETMYBOOKSBETHE"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
  Met us again and madly bent on us,
  You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
  By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
  Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
  By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


DCCLXXXI - "NTHEELOQUENCEA"

  Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
  To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
  His servant live, and will his vassal die:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
  Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
  Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
  Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
  Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.


DCCLXXXII - "NDDUMBPRESAGER"

  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  My state is desperate for my master's love;
  But sorrow flouted at is double death.
  Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.
  And free my country from calamity:
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


DCCLXXXIII - "SOFMYSPEAKINGB"

  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  Yet most suspected, as the time and place
  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.


DCCLXXXIV - "REASTWHOPLEADF"

  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  As many and as well-born bloods as those,--
  So doth the cony struggle in the net.
  That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
  Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
  He gains by death that hath such means to die:
  Or the light loss of England for a friend:
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  Lest we remember still that we have none.
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?


DCCLXXXV - "ORLOVEANDLOOKF"

  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
  Or by the father there were none at all;
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
  Like water from ye, never found again
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
  For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.


DCCLXXXVI - "ORRECOMPENSEMO"

  O noble prince, I can discover all
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
  Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
  My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!


DCCLXXXVII - "RETHANTHATTONG"

  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
  The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
  His honour and myself are at the one,
  A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
  The which shall turn you to no further harm
  To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  No more can I be sever'd from your side,
  God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!


DCCLXXXVIII - "UETHATMOREHATH"

  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  Things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
  He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
  As being well content with that alone.
  To give thee all, and in his waning age
  May honourable peace attend thy throne!
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
  And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
  Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.


DCCLXXXIX - "MOREEXPRESSDOL"

  Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
 eXcuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
  Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
  O, think my son to be as dear to me!
  Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!


DCCXC - "EARNTOREADWHAT"

  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And this may help to thicken other proofs
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
  The oldest have borne most; we that are young
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And she as much in love, her means much less
  Deserves your hate; and your affections are
  Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,
  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.


DCCXCI - "SILENTLOVEHATH"

  Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
  If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.


DCCXCII - "WRITTOHEARWITH"

  While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill.
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
  They surfeited with honey and began
  That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
  Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
  Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
  The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,
  How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!


DCCXCIII - "EYESBELONGSTOL"

  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  You something know; yet I believe there comes
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
  Stood challenger on mount of all the age
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
  Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.


DCCXCIV - "OVESFINEWITMIN"

  O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
  From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
  I should not live to speak another word;
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
  I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
  That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  In this hot trial, more than we of France;
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.


DCCXCV - "EEYEHATHPLAYDT"

  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
  Persuaded him from any further act:
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Are of imagination all compact:
  You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
  Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
  To say to me that thou art out of breath?


DCCXCVI - "HEPAINTERANDHA"

  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Rest on my word, and let not discontent
  Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  And come, young Cato; let us to the field.


DCCXCVII - "THSTELLDTHYBEA"

  Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
  Tell me wherein have I offended most?
  He did solicit you in free contempt
  Your native town you enter'd like a post,
  Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And more, much more. The time will bring it out.


DCCXCVIII - "UTYSFORMINTABL"

  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
  You may behold confusion of your foes.
  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
  Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  May all the building in my fancy pluck
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
  And what thou think'st his very action speaks
  But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!


DCCXCIX - "EOFMYHEARTMYBO"

  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  For quick accumulation of renown,
  My education been in arts and arms;
  You go not till I set you up a glass
  How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


DCCC - "DYISTHEFRAMEWH"

  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  To put an antic disposition on),
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  And answer was return'd that he will come.
  My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  When have I aught exacted at your hands,
  His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.


DCCCI - "EREINTISHELDAN"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  The sums I have collected shall express.
  I see things too, although you judge I wink.
  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
  And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
  Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.


DCCCII - "DPERSPECTIVEIT"

  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
  Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Could not again undo: it was mine art,
  Ten years are spent since first he undertook
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  It were not for your quiet nor your good,
  To do him all the grace and good I could.


DCCCIII - "ISTHEPAINTERSA"

  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
  To the succeeding royalty he leaves
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  And shining morning face, creeping like snail
  I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
  Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
  And do not interrupt me in my course.


DCCCIV - "RTFORTHROUGHTH"

  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down,
  For that he colour'd with his high estate,
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  Reward did threaten and encourage him,
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Have you importuned him by any means?


DCCCV - "EPAINTERMUSTYO"

  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
  And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
  I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
  Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
  That chair stand empty: but we all are men,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
  Of physiognomy might one behold!


DCCCVI - "USEEHISSKILLTO"

  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  How many years a mortal man may live.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
  Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Thy ear is liable; thy food is such
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.


DCCCVII - "FINDWHEREYOURT"

  For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
  In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  Did steal behind him as he lay along
  Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Robs me of that which not enriches him
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
  O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.


DCCCVIII - "RUEIMAGEPICTUR"

  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
  My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
  Art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
  Go then; and with a countenance as clear
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
  I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


DCCCIX - "EDLIESWHICHINM"

  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
  Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
  I did not think to be so sad to-night
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
  Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  I like you, lads; about your business straight;
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
  If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.


DCCCX - "YBOSOMSSHOPISH"

  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  Before the child himself felt he was sick:
  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  Or is it Dian, habited like her,
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
  Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
  How many women saw this child of his?


DCCCXI - "ANGINGSTILLTHA"

  Am I a queen in title and in style,
  No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  It is extempore, from my mother wit.
  Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
  To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!


DCCCXII - "THATHHISWINDOW"

  They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
  They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
  Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  I would your highness would depart the field:
  Set deadly enmity between two friends,
  What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
  I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
  When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.


DCCCXIII - "SGLAZEDWITHTHI"

  So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  At last she sees a wretched image bound,
  Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
  Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
  I pray you and beseech you that you will.
  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Have said and writ so, but your writing now
  I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!


DCCCXIV - "NEEYESNOWSEEWH"

  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  You would not then have parted with the ring.
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
  Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.


DCCCXV - "ATGOODTURNSEYE"

  As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
  True grief is fond and testy as a child,
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


DCCCXVI - "SFOREYESHAVEDO"

  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
  O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Sorrow so royally in you appears
  He was as calm as virtue--he began
  And most deceiving when it seems most just;
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  Or whether revolution be the same.


DCCCXVII - "NEMINEEYESHAVE"

  Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
  In no less working than are swords and bows
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  You go not till I set you up a glass
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Have put on black and loving mourners be,
  And therefore we must needs admit the means
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


DCCCXVIII - "DRAWNTHYSHAPEA"

  Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:
  What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
  Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
  Your gracious self to take on you the charge
  So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
  Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
  A way to make us better friends, more known.
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  And your sweet semblance to some other give.


DCCCXIX - "NDTHINEFORMEAR"

  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  Doing the execution and the act
  This accident is not unlike my dream:
  How shall we then dispense with that contract,
  In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
  Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
  O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.


DCCCXX - "EWINDOWSTOMYBR"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
  It may be good: pride hath no other glass
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  On Saturday we will return to France.
  Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
  Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
  But here's a villain that would face me down
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.


DCCCXXI - "EASTWHERETHROU"

  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  Which is as brief as I have known a play;
  Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
  His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  Upon this spotted and inconstant man.


DCCCXXII - "GHTHESUNDELIGH"

  Go, call before me all the lords in court.
  How have you made division of yourself?
  Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
  He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,
  Good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.


DCCCXXIII - "TSTOPEEPTOGAZE"

  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  To join your hearts in love and amity.
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
  That violates the smallest branch herein:
  Of all mad matches, never was the like.
  God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


DCCCXXIV - "THEREINONTHEEY"

  The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
  How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Invited her to supper: she replied,
  Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  That all the court may echo with the noise.
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Your father's heir must have your father's land.


DCCCXXV - "ETEYESTHISCUNN"

  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
  I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.


DCCCXXVI - "INGWANTTOGRACE"

  In courtly company or at my beads,
  Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
  Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
  Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
  Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
  Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
  The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
  To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


DCCCXXVII - "THEIRARTTHEYDR"

  This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
  The revenue whereof shall furnish us
  He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
  Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


DCCCXXVIII - "AWBUTWHATTHEYS"

  Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
  Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
  But edifies another with her deeds.
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  The duke, my husband and my children both,
  Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
  Say but the word, and I will be his priest.


DCCCXXIX - "EEKNOWNOTTHEHE"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
  When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
  Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
  O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
  This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
  The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


DCCCXXX - "ARTLETTHOSEWHO"

  Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  That put Armado's page out of his part!
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
  That I myself have done unto myself?
  His time of folly and his time of sport;
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
  Or that or any place that harbours men.


DCCCXXXI - "AREINFAVOURWIT"

  As, sick and blunted with community,
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Embrace we then this opportunity
  I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
  And rear it in the place your father's stands.
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
  I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
  There's none but asses will be bridled so.


DCCCXXXII - "HTHEIRSTARSOFP"

  His antidotes are poison, and he slays
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  Her more than haste is mated with delays,
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  The letter is too long by half a mile.
  And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
  Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
  One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
  For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
  Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.


DCCCXXXIII - "UBLICHONOURAND"

  Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
  But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
  Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
  I would the state of time had first been whole
  Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
  Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
  Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
  Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
  Not any, but abide the change of time,
  Drove back again unto my native clime?


DCCCXXXIV - "PROUDTITLESBOA"

  Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
  Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
  If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
  The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
  Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
  But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  And climb the highest promontory top.


DCCCXXXV - "STWHILSTIWHOMF"

  So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  What is it else? a madness most discreet,
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  She's such a one, that, were I well assured
  There's something in me that reproves my fault;
  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
  Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
  For hither we have broken in by force.


DCCCXXXVI - "ORTUNEOFSUCHTR"

  On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
  Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Could never go so slow: I have heard of
  His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
  To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


DCCCXXXVII - "IUMPHBARSUNLOO"

  If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  My love is as a fever, longing still
  Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
  He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
  Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Under whose colours he had fought so long.
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.


DCCCXXXVIII - "KDFORJOYINTHAT"

  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  For being ignorant to whom it goes
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  Your master's confidence was above mine;
  If haply you my father do suspect
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Then others for the breath of words respect,
  Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
  And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
  Then wish me better; I will give you leave.


DCCCXXXIX - "IHONOURMOSTGRE"

  I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
  How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


DCCCXL - "ATPRINCESFAVOU"

  As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
  The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Come, let us go: we will include all jars
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
  For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
  And, like a sister, am most loath to call
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?


DCCCXLI - "RITESTHEIRFAIR"

  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
  That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
  Troop in the throngs of military men;
  Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  I had forgot myself; am I not king?
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  From you have I been absent in the spring,
  Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
  If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


DCCCXLII - "LEAVESSPREADBU"

  Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!


DCCCXLIII - "TASTHEMARIGOLD"

  To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
  And say you would present her at the leet,
  Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
  To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
  He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  My gracious prince, and honourable peers,
  And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
  Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?


DCCCXLIV - "ATTHESUNSEYEAN"

  Are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
  Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
  That may with reasonable swiftness add
  Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  She shows a body rather than a life,
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
  Should dying men flatter with those that live?
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.


DCCCXLV - "DINTHEMSELVEST"

  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
  The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
  He hath brought many captives home to Rome
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.


DCCCXLVI - "HEIRPRIDELIESB"

  He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  I'll be damned for never a king's son in
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
  If he were living, I would try him yet.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Shall be transported presently to France.
  Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.


DCCCXLVII - "URIEDFORATAFRO"

  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  For, look you, I may make the belly smile
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
  The day is broke; be wary, look about.
  And, after conflict such as was supposed
  For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.


DCCCXLVIII - "WNTHEYINTHEIRG"

  Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
  Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  That so I may by this device at least
  Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?


DCCCXLIX - "LORYDIETHEPAIN"

  Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
  O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
  Disguise the holy strength of their command,
  It may be judged I made the duke away;
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  This is my birth-day; as this very day
  Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
  A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
  If low, an agate very vilely cut;
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.


DCCCL - "FULWARRIORFAMO"

  Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
  Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
  Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
  Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  I speak no more than what my soul intends;
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
  And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.


DCCCLI - "USEDFORFIGHTAF"

  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
  Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
  Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
  Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:
  Too good to be so and too bad to live,
  And not of any challenge of desert,
  For stones dissolved to water do convert.


DCCCLII - "TERATHOUSANDVI"

  That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  And warrant limited unto my tongue.
  To know what willing ransom he will give.
  How troublesome it sat upon my head:
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
  No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  Values itself so highly that to her
  I will determine this before I stir.


DCCCLIII - "CTORIESONCEFOI"

  Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
  Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
  None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  I never swore this lady such an oath.


DCCCLIV - "LDISFROMTHEBOO"

  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
  Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
  Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
  That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
  Happy were England, would this gracious prince
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  But not without that harmful stroke which since
  O, none of both but are of high desert:
  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.


DCCCLV - "KOFHONOURRAZED"

  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
  For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
  Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Now where is he that will not stay so long
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Under whose government come they along?
  Replies her husband: 'do not take away
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  As honour without breach of honour may
  Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?


DCCCLVI - "QUITEANDALLTHE"

  Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
  Them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
  No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
  Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
  And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
  Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
  Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


DCCCLVII - "RESTFORGOTFORW"

  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
  For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
  O, had they in that darksome prison died!
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  The king's late scruple, by the main assent
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
  Of that great shadow I did represent;
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.


DCCCLVIII - "HICHHETOILDTHE"

  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
  I do embrace your offer; and dispose
  Commanded always by the greater gust;
  Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
  Here on my knee I beg mortality,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  That rage in savage sensuality.
  O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
  It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
  Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.


DCCCLIX - "NHAPPYITHATLOV"

  Never so little show of love to her,
  He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
  As notes whose faculties inclusive were
  Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
  Particularities and petty sounds
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


DCCCLX - "EANDAMBELOVEDW"

  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
  As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  By what you see them act. Is there not charms
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  What three things does drink especially provoke?


DCCCLXI - "HEREIMAYNOTREM"

  Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
  Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
  And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights,
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Most just and heavy causes make oppose.


DCCCLXII - "OVENORBEREMOVE"

  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  But most it is presumption in us when
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DCCCLXIII - "DLORDOFMYLOVET"

  Did ever love so dearly: let her live
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
  O night, which ever art when day is not!
  For I have given here my soul's consent
  My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.


DCCCLXIV - "OWHOMINVASSALA"

  Only for praise: and praise we may afford
  Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
  Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  My mother told me just how he would woo,
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
  Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
  Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!


DCCCLXV - "GETHYMERITHATH"

  Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;
  His insolence draws folly from my lips;
  Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
  My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
  That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
  Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
  Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.


DCCCLXVI - "MYDUTYSTRONGLY"

  My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
  You never spoke what did become you less
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  That presses them and learns them first to bear,
  You're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
  So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
  Try many, all good, serve truly, never
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.


DCCCLXVII - "KNITTOTHEEISEN"

  Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  To free us from his father's wrathful curse,
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
  Take leave of thy old master and inquire
  Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  I have been begging sixteen years in court,
  Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Never lacks power to dismiss itself.


DCCCLXVIII - "DTHISWRITTENEM"

  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  He rush'd into my house and took perforce
  Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
  Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
  When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  If this but answer to my just belief,
  This, in the name of God, I promise here:
  That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Most abject in regard and dear in use!


DCCCLXIX - "BASSAGETOWITNE"

  By custom and the ordinance of times
  As now they are, and making practised smiles,
  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  Say to her, we have measured many miles
  Affliction till it do cry out itself
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  There is no composition in these news
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
  I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
  To the succeeding royalty he leaves
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


DCCCLXX - "SSDUTYNOTTOSHO"

  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  You use in abject and in slavish parts,
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  That you are well acquainted with yourself,
  That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
  Of female favour, and bestows himself
  Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


DCCCLXXI - "WMYWITDUTYSOGR"

  Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,
  My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear;
  Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
  With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
  I prithee go and get me some repast;
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Us friends; I will pursue the amity.
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
  You of my household, leave this peevish broil
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
  Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.


DCCCLXXII - "EATWHICHWITSOP"

  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  And dare upon the warrant of my note
  The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
  How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
  If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
  Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
  How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
  I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains
  Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.


DCCCLXXIII - "OORASMINEMAYMA"

  Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
  Of seeming sorrow--it is sure your own.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
  And both return back to their chairs again:
  Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
  Myself your loyal servant, or endure
  And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!


DCCCLXXIV - "KESEEMBAREINWA"

  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  Be happy that my arms are out of use:
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  I did obey, and sent my peasant home
  Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
  When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
  And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.


DCCCLXXV - "NTINGWORDSTOSH"

  Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
  Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
  Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  The fairest queen that ever king received.
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.


DCCCLXXVI - "OWITBUTTHATIHO"

  O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
  When our most learned doctors leave us and
  I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
  The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
  But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
  The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
  To visit other places; and come down
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
  To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.


DCCCLXXVII - "PESOMEGOODCONC"

  Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Say that before Ascension-day at noon
  Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Command thy son and daughter to join hands.


DCCCLXXVIII - "EITOFTHINEINTH"

  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
  The frame and huge foundation of the earth
  On 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
  Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
  I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!


DCCCLXXIX - "YSOULSTHOUGHTA"

  You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
  The anger of the king nor guilty of,
  Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
  Of what is to continue: never mind
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
  He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
  A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!


DCCCLXXX - "LLNAKEDWILLBES"

  Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
  And they have served me to effectless use:
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
  Without annoying me: and there were drawn
  I am undone: there is no living, none,
  Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
  Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
  But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!


DCCCLXXXI - "TOWITTILLWHATS"

  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
  One vice, but of a minute old, for one
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
  If you think fit, or that it may be done,
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
  It is religion that doth make vows kept;
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
  His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
  A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
  Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake
  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.


DCCCLXXXII - "OEVERSTARTHATG"

  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
  And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
  How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
  And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
  Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.
  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?


DCCCLXXXIII - "UIDESMYMOVINGP"

  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  March patiently along: let one be sent
  Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them
  My mother is assailed in our tent,
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I will myself into the pulpit first,
  Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.


DCCCLXXXIV - "OINTSONMEGRACI"

  O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  That with the very shaking of their chains
  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
  No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
  Crave harbourage within your city walls.
  I did present him with the Paris balls.


DCCCLXXXV - "OUSLYWITHFAIRA"

  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
  What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
  Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
  Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
  For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
  And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
  In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  And so once more return and tell his grace.


DCCCLXXXVI - "SPECTANDPUTSAP"

  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  Presents that I intend to send them both:
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
  Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
  And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
  Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
  These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
  So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
  And I unjustly too, must grant it you
  Please you, deliberate a day or two.


DCCCLXXXVII - "PARELONMYTATTE"

  Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
  And apprehend thee for a felon here.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
  O, none of both but are of high desert:
  Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
  Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;
  And more such days as these to us befall!
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


DCCCLXXXVIII - "RDLOVINGTOSHOW"

  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Of nature and of nations speak aloud
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
  Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
  She is a woman, therefore may be won;
  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.


DCCCLXXXIX - "MEWORTHYOFTHYS"

  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  From the first corse till he that died to-day,
  To show how quaint an orator you are:
  He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
  Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
  Still live they and for ever may they last!


DCCCXC - "WEETRESPECTTHE"

  What tributaries follow him to Rome,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Thou art too noble to conserve a life
  He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.


DCCCXCI - "NMAYIDARETOBOA"

  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
  And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  If it be that, or any that was hers,
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
  Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  But bring they what they will and what they can,
  On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.


DCCCXCII - "STHOWIDOLOVETH"

  Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
  Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave:
  Have of their puissance made a little taste.
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


DCCCXCIII - "EETILLTHENNOTS"

  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
  I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
  That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.


DCCCXCIV - "HOWMYHEADWHERE"

  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
  When we were happy we had other names.
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
  When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


DCCCXCV - "THOUMAYSTPROVE"

  They can be meek that have no other cause.
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
  An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
  Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
  Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


DCCCXCVI - "MEWEARYWITHTOI"

  My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
  What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
  I would the fool were married to her grave!
  That, notwithstanding thy capacity
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  They had such courage and audacity?
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.


DCCCXCVII - "LIHASTEMETOMYB"

  Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,
  I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
  At this encounter do so much admire
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
  O, let my sovereign turn away his face
  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
  Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.


DCCCXCVIII - "EDTHEDEARREPOS"

  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  Drest in a little brief authority,
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Holds from all soldiers chief majority
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  As in these cases, where the aim reports,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Please you, deliberate a day or two.
  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
  Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.


DCCCXCIX - "EFORLIMBSWITHT"

  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense
  If on my credit you dare build so far
  Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
  Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  With the rude multitude till I return.
  If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
  The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
  Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.


CM - "RAVELTIREDBUTT"

  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
  I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.
  The liker you; few taller are so young.


CMI - "HENBEGINSAJOUR"

  He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
  But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
  I rather of his absence make this use:
  No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Answer I must and shall do with my life.
  Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


CMII - "NEYINMYHEADTOW"

  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
  No, my good lord; I met him back again.
  Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
  You can say none of this: well, grant it then
  He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
  Or lowly factor for another's gain;
  When think you that the sword goes up again?


CMIII - "ORKMYMINDWHENB"

  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
  More than in women commonly is seen,
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
  Idly supposed the founder of this law;
  Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
  Defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
  Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?


CMIV - "ODYSWORKSEXPIR"

  Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
  Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
  Yet not the son; I will not call him son
  So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
  Without thy help by me be borne alone.
  Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
 eXcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
  I shall be reconciled to him again.
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


CMV - "EDFORTHENMYTHO"

  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
  O, if you raise this house against this house,
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
  My speech and what is done, tell him he has
  Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
  Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!


CMVI - "UGHTSFROMFARWH"

  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
  He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
  To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
  Sorry I am my noble cousin should
  For exile hath more terror in his look,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Must be provided for: and you shall put
  For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong
  And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Which she hath praised him with above compare
  Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.


CMVII - "EREIABIDEINTEN"

  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
  A second night of such sweet shortness which
  Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  If I say sooth, I must report they were
  Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
  That this remotion of the Duke and her
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.


CMVIII - "DAZEALOUSPILGR"

  Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
  And make me happy in your unity.
  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
  Embrace we then this opportunity
  And make a riot on the gentle brow
  Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
  O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
  Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
  So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
  Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
  If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


CMIX - "IMAGETOTHEEAND"

  If ever sat at any good man's feast,
  Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
  As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
  Got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
  His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  A largess universal like the sun
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.


CMX - "KEEPMYDROOPING"

  Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
  More than his singularity, he goes
  Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
  Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
  Proud can I never be of what I hate;
  I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
  Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
  God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!


CMXI - "EYELIDSOPENWID"

  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  You spurn'd me such a day; another time
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Losing his verdure even in the prime
  Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
  Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
  Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
  Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
  Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
  When I protest true loyalty to her,
  If he were putting to my house the brand
  Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.


CMXII - "ELOOKINGONDARK"

  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
  Is not infected: but if one present
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  God hold it, to your honour's good content!
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Not like to me, or any of my kin,
  Did he so often lodge in open field,
  And proofs as clear as founts in July when
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Keeps good old York there with his men of war?


CMXIII - "NESSWHICHTHEBL"

  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
  So many hours must I sport myself;
  What maintenance he from his friends receives,
  He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


CMXIV - "INDDOSEESAVETH"

  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
  Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.


CMXV - "ATMYSOULSIMAGI"

  Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
  Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
  I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
  My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:
  And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
  Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
  It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.


CMXVI - "NARYSIGHTPRESE"

  No! why? When he that is my husband now
  A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  You that will be less fearful than discreet,
  Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
  I must unto the road, to disembark
  Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
  Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


CMXVII - "NTSTHYSHADOWTO"

  Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
  That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
  Summon their general unto the wall.
  The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
  His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
  That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?


CMXVIII - "MYSIGHTLESSVIE"

  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
  Since he's so great can make his will his act,
  If with a lady of so high resolve
  Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  To wring the widow from her custom'd right,
  Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
  Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


CMXIX - "WWHICHLIKEAJEW"

  Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
  What I should do again for such a sake.
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  In my oration, how the people take
  Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
  Has done no more than other knights have done;
  Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
  Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.


CMXX - "ELHUNGINGHASTL"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  Her aid she promised and assured success:
  Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  Hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
  And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
  So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
  This part of his conjoins with my disease
  Let's step into the shadow of these trees.


CMXXI - "YNIGHTMAKESBLA"

  Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
  Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
  Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
  More than, I fear, you are provided for.
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
  Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  And make my image but an alehouse sign.


CMXXII - "CKNIGHTBEAUTEO"

  Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
  If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
  Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  These that I bring unto their latest home,
  But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.


CMXXIII - "USANDHEROLDFAC"

  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
  And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
  Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
  Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
  Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  Live here in heaven and may look on her;
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Find no determination: then you were
  And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
  Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?


CMXXIV - "ENEWLOTHUSBYDA"

  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
  To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
  He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
  Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,
  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  And bring me their opinions of success.


CMXXV - "YMYLIMBSBYNIGH"

  Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
  Makes vow before his uncle never more
  You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  I could have well diverted her intents,
  My health and happy being at your court.
  Big discontent so breaking their contents.
  Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
  By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
  You were advis'd his flesh was capable
  Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  Is not your father grown incapable
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Here was a royal fellowship of death!


CMXXVI - "TMYMINDFORTHEE"

  To melt the city leads upon your pates,
  Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
  You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
  Myself hath often over-heard them say,
  It would be much vexation to your age.
  No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Have by the very cunning of the scene
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


CMXXVII - "ANDFORMYSELFNO"

  As dear be to thee as thy father was.
  Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
  Depose him in the justice of his cause.
  Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
  Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
  Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
  Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
  You shall not choose but drink before you go;
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.


CMXXVIII - "QUIETFINDHOWCA"

  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  I rather of his absence make this use:
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
  For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
  He did solicit you in free contempt
  Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
  And like a mountain, not to be removed.


CMXXIX - "NITHENRETURNIN"

  Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
  I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.
  Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your
  He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  That him and his they in his palace burn;
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.


CMXXX - "HAPPYPLIGHTTHA"

  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
  Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
  Presence must be the whip of the other.
  You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.
  Proud of employment, willingly I go.
  Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
  In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
  Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
  He and his lady both are at the lodge
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!


CMXXXI - "TAMDEBARRDTHEB"

  Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
  And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
  My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  But to my mind, though I am native here
  And the nobility of Rome are his:
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
  How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  But I will have them, if I once know where.


CMXXXII - "ENEFITOFRESTWH"

  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
  I gave bold way to my authority
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
  That was not forced; that never was inclined
  With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
  Here is a silly stately style indeed!


CMXXXIII - "ENDAYSOPPRESSI"

  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
  You said the enemy would not come down,
  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  In this the madman justly chargeth them.


CMXXXIV - "ONISNOTEASEDBY"

  Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
  Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
  It is not so with Him that all things knows
  Seditious to his grace and to the state.
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Do with your injuries as seems you best,
  But did you not request to have it cut?
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.


CMXXXV - "NIGHTBUTDAYBYN"

  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
  Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
  Themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
  Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  Descended of so many royal kings.
  And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;
  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
  Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.


CMXXXVI - "IGHTANDNIGHTBY"

  I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
  Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
  And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
  Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
  But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
  Your worth is very dear in my regard.


CMXXXVII - "DAYOPPRESSDAND"

  Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!
  Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
  Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
  No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
  Dim register and notary of shame!


CMXXXVIII - "EACHTHOUGHENEM"

  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
  Than doth become a man. I will remain
  How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
  Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


CMXXXIX - "IESTOEITHERSRE"

  I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  She's such a one, that, were I well assured
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  I gave bold way to my authority
  To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
  How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


CMXL - "IGNDOINCONSENT"

  In argument and proof of which contract,
  Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.


CMXLI - "SHAKEHANDSTOTO"

  So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
  And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
  Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
  Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
  Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
  Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.


CMXLII - "RTUREMETHEONEB"

  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
  Upon this promise did he raise his chin,
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  His company must do his minions grace,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.


CMXLIII - "YTOILTHEOTHERT"

  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
  O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
  Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
  Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
  He lives that loves thee better than he could.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  That makes me reasonless to reason thus?


CMXLIV - "OCOMPLAINHOWFA"

  O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  Officers, what offence have these men done?
  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  And reason flies the object of all harm:
  Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
  Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  Or let me die, to look on death no more!
  Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
  For I will make him tell the tale anew,
  Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.


CMXLV - "RITOILSTILLFAR"

  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
  To link my dear friend to a common stale.
  Only compound me with forgotten dust;
  In at his window; set this up with wax
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
  In quantity equals not one of yours:
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  For now I stand as one upon a rock
  And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


CMXLVI - "THEROFFFROMTHE"

  Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
  He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  For loving where you do: but if yourself,
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
  He never can meet more mischance than come
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


CMXLVII - "EITELLTHEDAYTO"

  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  I am afraid to think what I have done;
  This done, he took the bride about the neck,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.
  That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
  How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!


CMXLVIII - "PLEASETHEMTHOU"

  Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
  Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  More bright in zeal than the devotion which
  The Romans plausibly did give consent
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.


CMXLIX - "ARTBRIGHTANDDO"

  A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  But be it as it may: I here entail
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.


CML - "STHIMGRACEWHEN"

  She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  He was as calm as virtue--he began
  I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
  My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Am I a queen in title and in style,
  Caesar and Antony have ever won
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  We are to reap the harvest of his son.
  Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.


CMLI - "CLOUDSDOBLOTTH"

  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
  Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  O, two such silver currents, when they join,
  Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  The honourable board of council out,
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.


CMLII - "EHEAVENSOFLATT"

  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  And am not I a prelate of the church?
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  No! why? When he that is my husband now
  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
  O sacred receptacle of my joys,
  From London by the king was I press'd forth;
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?


CMLIII - "ERITHESWARTCOM"

  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
  Takes on the point of honour to support
  How like the prodigal doth she return,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
  Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
  And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
  Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
  Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
  Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.


CMLIV - "PLEXIONDNIGHTW"

  Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
 eXpecting in return twenty for one?
  I never heard a passion so confused,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  He would not stay at your petitions: made
  The other lords, like lions wanting food,
  Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.


CMLV - "HENSPARKLINGST"

  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
  Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  I jest to Oberon and make him smile
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!


CMLVI - "ARSTWIRENOTTHO"

  Are idly bent on him that enters next,
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  So much against the mettle of your sex,
  This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
  Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
  In my good brother's fault: I know not why
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Either to get the town again or die:
  No bargains break that are not this day made:
  Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
  Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
  To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
  He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!


CMLVII - "UGILDSTTHEEVEN"

  Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
  Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  The use of your own virtues, for the which
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.


CMLVIII - "BUTDAYDOTHDAIL"

  Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
  Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
  The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;
  He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
  I will perform it to enfranchise you.
  Live cleanly as a nobleman should do.


CMLIX - "YDRAWMYSORROWS"

  You stand upon the ravage and behold
  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  Strengthen'd with what apology you think
  O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  So great a day as this is cheaply bought.


CMLX - "LONGERANDNIGHT"

  Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
  Of either's colour was the other queen,
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
  Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
  Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
  To be mine own attorney in this case.


CMLXI - "DOTHNIGHTLYMAK"

  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
  To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
  I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
  Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
  How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
  To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
  My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
  Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
  King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?


CMLXII - "EGRIEFSSTRENGT"

  Either of king or council, when you went
  Gave me my being and my father first,
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  For many years thought dead, are now revived,
  So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
  She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
  To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
  God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
  Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.


CMLXIII - "HSEEMSTRONGERW"

  He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep
  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
  Since why to love I can allege no cause.
  The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
  Go with the princes, or stay here with us?
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die.


CMLXIV - "HENINDISGRACEW"

  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  It shall become thee well to act my woes;
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  And got a calf in that same noble feat
  Cause the musicians play me that sad note
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?


CMLXV - "ITHFORTUNEANDM"

  In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
  Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
  He hath a garden circummured with brick,
  Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
  Never durst poet touch a pen to write
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.


CMLXVI - "ENSEYESIALLALO"

  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
  Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  I like you, lads; about your business straight;
  And treasure of my loins; then if I would
  Let's have your company, or, if you please,
  Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
  And made me almost yield upon my knees.
  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
  O, know he is the bridle of your will.


CMLXVII - "NEBEWEEPMYOUTC"

  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
  Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
  You give away this hand, and that is mine;
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?


CMLXVIII - "ASTSTATEANDTRO"

  As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:
  Than a wild dedication of yourselves
  And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
  Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Against the panting sides of his poor jade
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!


CMLXIX - "UBLEDEAFHEAVEN"

  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  But cannot make my heart consent to take
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
  From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
  He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.


CMLXX - "WITHMYBOOTLESS"

  Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
  If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
  The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  More upon humour than advised respect.
  You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
  Base men, that use them to so base effect!
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  That may repeat and history his los
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
  Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.


CMLXXI - "CRIESANDLOOKUP"

  Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  As little is the wisdom, where the flight
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
  Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
  Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
  Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!


CMLXXII - "ONMYSELFANDCUR"

  O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
  Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
  So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Let them want nothing that my house affords.
  France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
  And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
  No, truly; it is more than manners will:
  Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
  Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


CMLXXIII - "SEMYFATEWISHIN"

  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  My purse, my person, my extremest means,
  You know I am a woman, lacking wit
  Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
  And have no more of life than may suffice
  That for thyself: I will not so presume
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
  Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  If he be old enough, what needs your grace
  Never came poison from so sweet a place.


CMLXXIV - "GMELIKETOONEMO"

  Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
  I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
  Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
  O, that your young nobility could judge
  O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  My love with words and errors still she feeds;
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


CMLXXV - "RERICHINHOPEFE"

  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  Hop forty paces through the public street;
  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  How tame, when men and women are alone,
  O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


CMLXXVI - "ATUREDLIKEHIML"

  All preparation for a bloody siege
  They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
  Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Indeed the top of admiration! worth
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  How well my comfort is revived by this!
  If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.


CMLXXVII - "IKEHIMWITHFRIE"

  Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
  I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,
  My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  We may effect this business yet ere day.
  I think his understanding is bereft.
  The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
  Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
  For here he doth demand to have repaid
  Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
  I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


CMLXXVIII - "NDSPOSSESSDDES"

  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
  Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.
  Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
  Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
  Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.


CMLXXIX - "IRINGTHISMANSA"

  I know I am too mean to be your queen,
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
  No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  That he should be my fool and I his fate.
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  It pleas'd the King his master very late
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  And that you not delay the present, but,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
  And useth it to patronage his theft.


CMLXXX - "RTANDTHATMANSS"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  The repetition cannot make it less;
  A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  He might return to vasty Tartar back,
  And with a sudden reinforcement struck
  The sun will set before I shall discharge
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
  So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.


CMLXXXI - "COPEWITHWHATIM"

  Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.
  Or overthrow incurable ensues.
  Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
  In no less working than are swords and bows
  To nature none more bound; his training such,
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  With honour of his birthright to the crown.
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
  To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
  In his descent than shall my prompted sword
  Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.


CMLXXXII - "OSTENJOYCONTEN"

  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
  The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
  One poor retiring minute in an age
  Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
  Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.


CMLXXXIII - "TEDLEASTYETINT"

  To do your pleasure and continue friends.
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
  Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  To business with the King, more than the scope
  If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
  Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
  That two such noble peers as ye should jar!


CMLXXXIV - "HESETHOUGHTSMY"

  How with mine honour may I give him that
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
  His eye begets occasion for his wit;
  O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  The purest treasure mortal times afford
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.


CMLXXXV - "SELFALMOSTDESP"

  Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:
  Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
  And call him noble that was now your hate,
  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
  Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
  Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?


CMLXXXVI - "ISINGHAPLYITHI"

  I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
  Score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
  I shall obey you in all fair commands.
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
  And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
  Please it your honour knock but at the gate,
  Labouring men; and therefore should we be
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
  The night to the owl and morn to the lark
  He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
  I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.


CMLXXXVII - "NKONTHEEANDTHE"

  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  King John, this is the very sum of all;
  O that there were some virtue in my tears,
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
  No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  The one will live, the other being dead:
  He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


CMLXXXVIII - "NMYSTATELIKETO"

  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  You not your child well loving, yet I find
  Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
  To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
  And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
  This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
  It is not for your health thus to commit
  Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!


CMLXXXIX - "THELARKATBREAK"

  That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
  Here am I left to underprop his land,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
  And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
  Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
  Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  As with your shadow I with these did play:
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.


CMXC - "OFDAYARISINGFR"

  O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  For but a month ago I went from hence,
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  And, like a hungry lion, did commence
  You that be noble; help him, young and old!
  Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
  Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
  It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
  For never anything can be amiss,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


CMXCI - "OMSULLENEARTHS"

  O, full of careful business are his looks!
  Must be provided for: and you shall put
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
  Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
  Like little body with a mighty heart,
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  That scald'st with safety. By his gates of breath
  His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
  She is not for your turn, the more my grief.


CMXCII - "INGSHYMNSATHEA"

  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  Shall more attend upon the coming space,
  He was my master; and I wore my life
  Yes, something you can deny for your own
  My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
  No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
  A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  How shall I know if I do choose the right?
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  And with his knee the door he opens wide.


CMXCIII - "VENSGATEFORTHY"

  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  Say that I did all this for love of her.
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  And he may well in fretting spend his gall,
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  For here I read for certain that my ships
  O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  Than misery itself would give; rewards
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.


CMXCIV - "SWEETLOVEREMEM"

  Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
  La main? elle est appelee de hand.
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  My part thereof that I have done to her.


CMXCV - "BERDSUCHWEALTH"

  Being the time the potion's force should cease.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  See you the fornicatress be removed:
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
  His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
  Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  And often at his very loose decides
  Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.


CMXCVI - "BRINGSTHATTHEN"

  Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
  Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
  I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
  Now present here together: that's to say,
  Go fetch them hither to us presently.
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
  And on that day at noon whereon he says
  There was a pretty redness in his lip,
  Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.


CMXCVII - "ISCORNTOCHANGE"

  I should report that which I say I saw,
  Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
  Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
  O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  A villain kills my father; and for that,
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


CMXCVIII - "MYSTATEWITHKIN"

  Matter against him that for ever mars
  You may as well forbid the mountain pines
  Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
  To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
  And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
  To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
  In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
  That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;
  Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
  No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.


CMXCIX - "GSWHENTOTHESES"

  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
  Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
  That he thereby may give a likely guess
  On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.


M - "SIONSOFSWEETSI"

  See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
  Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
  O constancy, be strong upon my side,
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  Order gave each thing view; the office did
  From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  What Antony shall speak, I will protest
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  Strange images of death. As thick as hail
  I think I should have told your grace's tale.


MI - "LENTTHOUGHTISU"

  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Not possible; for who shall bear your part
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  There is an art which in their piedness shares
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.


MII - "MMONUPREMEMBRA"

  Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Men at some time are masters of their fates:
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
  But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  And think it but a minute spent in sport.


MIII - "NCEOFTHINGSPAS"

  No new device to beat this from his brains?
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
  To make more vent for passage of her breath;
  How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
  I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.
  Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:
  Pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
  A mother and a mistress and a friend,
  Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.


MIV - "TISIGHTHELACKO"

  The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
  Grew a companion to the common streets,
  He was not taken well; he had not dined:
  The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
  He is complete in feature and in mind
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Lesser his person than an ill report;
  And when the morning sun shall raise his car
  Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.


MV - "FMANYATHINGISO"

  From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
  Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
  And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
  Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
  You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
  Acquainted me with interest to this land,
  To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
  Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
  If not, why then, this parting was well made.
  Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  I am a subject fit to jest withal,
  Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
  O graceless men! they know not what they do.


MVI - "UGHTANDWITHOLD"

  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
  How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
  Themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
  And will not palter? and what other oath
  Nor can imagination form a shape,
  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  Where bloody murder or detested rape
  I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
  This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
  Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.


MVII - "WOESNEWWAILMYD"

  Whose tenors and particular effects
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
  Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
  In parcels as I did, would have gone near
  Led by their master to the flowered fields,
  Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?


MVIII - "EARTIMESWASTET"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  My love admits no qualifying dross;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
  Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
  So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
  Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  That men must lay their murders on your neck.


MIX - "HENCANIDROWNAN"

  Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
  And entertain'd me with mine own device;
  Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
  I was not much afeard; for once or twice
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
  Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.


MX - "EYEUNUSEDTOFLO"

  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Upon the love and truth and vows which I
  Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
  Shotten herring. There live not three good men
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  The ocean, overpeering of his list,
  Or on Diana's altar to protest
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.


MXI - "WFORPRECIOUSFR"

  Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
  For many lives stand between me and home:
  Or as tie heresies that men do leave
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!


MXII - "IENDSHIDINDEAT"

  It will outrun you, father, in the end.
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  He is as worthy for an empress' love
  Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
  I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
  Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.


MXIII - "HSDATELESSNIGH"

  How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
  Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  And salt too little which may season give
  To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
  Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.
  Here must I stay, and here my life must end.


MXIV - "TANDWEEPAFRESH"

  To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
  A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
  And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
  For he was likely, had he been put on,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
  Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.


MXV - "LOVESLONGSINCE"

  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
  Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
  Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
  Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
  Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
  If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
  Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MXVI - "CANCELLDWOEAND"

  Came short of composition, but in chief
  A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Did call my father, was I know not where
  Wherein my sword had not impressure made
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  And climb the highest promontory top.
  Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:
  Do summon us to part and bid good night.


MXVII - "MOANTHEEXPENSE"

  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
  And Talbot perisheth by your default.
  Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
 eXcept mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
  Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MXVIII - "OFMANYAVANISHD"

  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
  From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
  Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
  Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
  You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
  And give you entrance: but without this match,
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.


MXIX - "SIGHTTHENCANIG"

  Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
  If ever he have wife, let her he made
  Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
  He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Never so much as in a thought unborn
  Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
  As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
  Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
  Inferring arguments of mighty force.
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.


MXX - "RIEVEATGRIEVAN"

  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  I swear to do this, though a present death
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.


MXXI - "CESFOREGONEAND"

  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
  O, love's best habit is a soothing tongue,
  Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Distasted with the salt of broken tears.


MXXII - "HEAVILYFROMWOE"

  How true a gentleman you send relief,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  I would your highness would depart the field:
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Of thy deep duty more impression show
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MXXIII - "TOWOETELLOERTH"

  The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
  Or not remember what I must be now!
  Which he enforced from me, away he posts
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
  Or any of my brothers of the state,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
  Have done, for more I hardly can endure.


MXXIV - "ESADACCOUNTOFF"

  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Since then hath made between them. Unto her
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  Call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Under whose government come they along?
  Not all these lords do vex me half so much
  To spend that shortness basely were too long,
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  For certain words he spake against your grace
  Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!


MXXV - "OREBEMOANEDMOA"

  Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  May't please your majesty to give us leave
  Of hell would not in reputation change:
  And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
  Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Did to his predecessors part withal.
  My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
  Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
  And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.


MXXVI - "NWHICHINEWPAYA"

  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
  Can set the duke up in despite of me.
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
  Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
  Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
  You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
  Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.


MXXVII - "SIFNOTPAIDBEFO"

  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
  From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
  The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
  Princes in this should live like gods above,
  And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
  I thought upon one pair of English legs
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
  On what compulsion must I? tell me that.


MXXVIII - "REBUTIFTHEWHIL"

  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
  I shall; and bring his answer presently.
  For as I am, I live upon the rack.
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Had not been here to dress the ugly form
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
  His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
  I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.


MXXIX - "EITHINKONTHEED"

  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  The practise and the purpose of the king:
  He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
  Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
  Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
  Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
  On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  The purest treasure mortal times afford
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.


MXXX - "EARFRIENDALLLO"

  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  And pity her for her good father's sake;
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  For those that were, it is not square to take
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
  Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.


MXXXI - "SSESARERESTORE"

  So mighty and so many my defects,
  Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Against that time, if ever that time come,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MXXXII - "DANDSORROWSEND"

  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
  Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
  Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?


MXXXIII - "THYBOSOMISENDE"

  Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
  He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
  You must think this, look you, that the worm will
  But yet I would your father had been here.
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
  O, full of careful business are his looks!
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.


MXXXIV - "AREDWITHALLHEA"

  A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Death is the fairest cover for her shame
  When tempest of commotion, like the south,
  Is to mistake again; though indirect,
  Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
  He lived from all attainder of suspect.
  And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.


MXXXV - "RTSWHICHIBYLAC"

  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  So, either by thy picture or my love,
  Wherein we are not destitute for want,
  His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
  I had my father's signet in my purse,
  Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
  But from this lady may proceed a gem
  You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
  Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!


MXXXVI - "KINGHAVESUPPOS"

  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  It made me laugh to see the villain run.
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
  Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
  And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.


MXXXVII - "EDDEADANDTHERE"

  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  And to proclaim it civilly, were like
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Deservedly confined into this rock,
  The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MXXXVIII - "REIGNSLOVEANDA"

  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
  Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
  No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  As much as I can do, I will effect:
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
  And shame thine honourable age with blood?


MXXXIX - "LLLOVESLOVINGP"

  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
  Levy great sums of money through the realm
  Of dire combustion and confused events
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.
  Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
  Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  I never did repent for doing good,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Prince John, your son, doth kiss your Grace's hand.


MXL - "ARTSANDALLTHOS"

  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
  And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
  O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.


MXLI - "EFRIENDSWHICHI"

  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  I must confess that I have heard so much,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
  Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
  Coming from thee, I could not put him back,
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  Into this chiefest thicket of the park.


MXLII - "THOUGHTBURIEDH"

  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
  O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
  Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  I see you what you are, you are too proud;
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.


MXLIII - "OWMANYAHOLYAND"

  One time or other break some gallows' back.
  When he stands where I am and sees you there.
  My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
  And with her breath she did perfume the air;
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
  And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
  He fables not; I hear the enemy:
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Do all men kill the things they do not love?


MXLIV - "OBSEQUIOUSTEAR"

  Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
  Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
  Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Upon whose age we void it up again,
  In thine own person answer thy abuse.
  O momentary grace of mortal men,
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
  To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  According to the statute of the town,
  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.


MXLV - "HATHDEARRELIGI"

  He sought to murder: but her better stars
  And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
  This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Let us complain to them what fools were here,
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
  In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.


MXLVI - "OUSLOVESTOLNFR"

  O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  For none abides with me: my joy is death;
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MXLVII - "OMMINEEYEASINT"

  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  Might go one way, and safely; and the end
  My love is as a fever, longing still
  I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
  So call the field to rest; and let's away,
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
  There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.


MXLVIII - "ERESTOFTHEDEAD"

  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  To his most royal person, hither come
  On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
  For such disguise as haply shall become
  That majesty, to keep decorum, must
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  And so suppose am I; for in his grave
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?


MXLIX - "WHICHNOWAPPEAR"

  What nearer debt in all humanity
  Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
  I can no longer brook thy vanities.
  Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  Now will we take some order in the town,
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
  And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


ML - "BUTTHINGSREMOV"

  By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
  The next degree is England's royal throne;
  He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,
  If broken, then it is no fault of mine.
  Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MLI - "EDTHATHIDDENIN"

  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:
  Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
  It shows my earnestness of affection-
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.


MLII - "THEELIETHOUART"

  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  If in which time expired, he not return,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  He could not stay to pick them in a pile
  Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  This will I do, and soon return again.


MLIII - "THEGRAVEWHEREB"

  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
  He rather means to lodge you in the field,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  When he himself might his quietus make
  Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Being the time the potion's force should cease.


MLIV - "URIEDLOVEDOTHL"

  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?


MLV - "IVEHUNGWITHTHE"

  I am solicited, not by a few,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
  Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:
  In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
  The greatest of your having lacks a half
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MLVI - "TROPHIESOFMYLO"

  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Of my word, I have written to effect;
  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
  He came too late, the ship was under sail:
  I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
  Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
  For stones dissolved to water do convert.
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  You less know how to value her desert
  Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
  O gentlemen, the time of life is short!


MLVII - "VERSGONEWHOALL"

  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
  Or any of my brothers of the state,
  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.


MLVIII - "THEIRPARTSOFME"

  Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
  Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Then son and father weep with equal strife
  Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
  Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
  Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
  My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MLIX - "TOTHEEDIDGIVET"

  That brings me food to make misfortune live?
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  The old bees die, the young possess their hive:
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
  Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
  God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
  I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?


MLX - "HATDUEOFMANYNO"

  Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
  Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
  For one fair French maid that stands in my way.
  Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
  And leave no memory of what it was!
  Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
  You drew your sword upon me without cause;
  Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?


MLXI - "WISTHINEALONET"

  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
  I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
  Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
  The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
  His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Take in your love, and then let me alone.


MLXII - "HEIRIMAGESILOV"

  He saves my labour by his own approach.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  In confutation of which rude reproach
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  If any power pities wretched tears,
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  As I have such a heart that both mine ears
  Good King, that must approve the common saw,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
  Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MLXIII - "EDIVIEWINTHEEA"

  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  Into the danger of this adverse town;
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
  I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.


MLXIV - "NDTHOUALLTHEYH"

  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  His present and your pains we thank you for:
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
  Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  You know your places: God be with you all!
  He that takes that doth take my heart withal.


MLXV - "ASTALLTHEALLOF"

  Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
  Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  Against the welkin volleys out his voice;
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  Let villany itself forswear't. I must
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.


MLXVI - "MEIFTHOUSURVIV"

  My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  From you have I been absent in the spring,
  To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  I make my love engrafted to this store:
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MLXVII - "EMYWELLCONTENT"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
  Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out
  With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Levy great sums of money through the realm
  Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
  O, none of both but are of high desert:
  Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  The crest of youth against your dignity.


MLXVIII - "EDDAYWHENTHATC"

  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
  Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
  As they fly by them with their woven wings.
  Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
  Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
  Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
  That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  And in this state she gallops night by night
  To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
  Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.


MLXIX - "HURLDEATHMYBON"

  How long a time lies in one little word!
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
  That is too much presumption on thy part:
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
  By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.


MLXX - "ESWITHDUSTSHAL"

  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;
  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  The help of one stands me in little stead.
  How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
  During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Since why to love I can allege no cause.
  The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?


MLXXI - "LCOVERANDSHALT"

  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Embrace we then this opportunity
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  And make me happy in your unity.
  Not resolute, except so much were done;
  Deliver him to safety; and return,
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
  Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.


MLXXII - "BYFORTUNEONCEM"

  Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
  For where thou art, there is the world itself,
  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
  Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!


MLXXIII - "ORERESURVEYTHE"

  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  So many hours must I take my rest;
  Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MLXXIV - "SEPOORRUDELINE"

  Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Unto a woman, happy but for me,
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MLXXV - "SOFTHYDECEASED"

  Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
  O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
  For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  He shall have merely justice and his bond.
  Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
  Send for the county; go tell him of this:
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.


MLXXVI - "LOVERCOMPARETH"

  Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  Could all my travels warrant me they live.
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  May draw with you: there's millions now alive
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.


MLXXVII - "EMWITHTHEBETTE"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
  Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,
  Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
  To outface me with leaping in her grave?
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MLXXVIII - "RINGOFTHETIMEA"

  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  It is not for your health thus to commit
  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Give me the letter; I will look on it.
  O, none of both but are of high desert:
  Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  How joyful am I made by this contract!
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  That his attendant--so his case was like,
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And such an instrument I was to use.


MLXXIX - "NDTHOUGHTHEYBE"

  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  Hadst thou descended from another house.
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  How often said, my dignity would last
  This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
  Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
  But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MLXXX - "OUTSTRIPPDBYEV"

  Of the all-building law; and that there were
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  The king with mighty and quick-raised power
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
  Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  But thus his simple truth must be abused
  Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MLXXXI - "ERYPENRESERVET"

  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.


MLXXXII - "HEMFORMYLOVENO"

  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
  For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
  Of any thing the image tell me that
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
  Your potent and infectious fevers heap
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


MLXXXIII - "TFORTHEIRRHYME"

  There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
  For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
  He says they can do nothing in this kind.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MLXXXIV - "EXCEEDEDBYTHEH"

  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
 eXposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  Beggar the estimation which you prized
  Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.


MLXXXV - "EIGHTOFHAPPIER"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  For's private friends: his answer to me was,
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
  Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
  Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
  I take it up; and by that sword I swear
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.


MLXXXVI - "MENOTHENVOUCHS"

  Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
  He would show most love. When yet he was but
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  Have no perfection of my summer left,
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.


MLXXXVII - "AFEMEBUTTHISLO"

  As having sense of beauty, do omit
  Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
  Under that colour am I come to scale
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds
  Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
  Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.


MLXXXVIII - "VINGTHOUGHTHAD"

  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
  Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
  Give me some music; music, moody food
  That never object pleasing in thine eye,
  Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
  O, let me in my present wildness die,
  Upon her patient breast, making their way
  Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
  Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
  To hopeless restitution, so he might
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
  Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.


MLXXXIX - "MYFRIENDSMUSEG"

  My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
  Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.
  So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
  Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.


MXC - "ROWNWITHTHISGR"

  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Of any thing the image tell me that
  Which better fits a lion than a man.
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Without annoying me: and there were drawn
  If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
  Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
  Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
  Had graced the tender temples of my child,
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


MXCI - "OWINGAGEADEARE"

  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
  I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
  As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Either to get the town again or die:
  An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MXCII - "RBIRTHTHANTHIS"

  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  By computation and mine host's report.
  I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
  Not possible; for who shall bear your part
  Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
  Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
  I put myself to thy direction, and
  Since they do better thee in their command.


MXCIII - "HISLOVEHADBROU"

  Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;
  A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  By computation and mine host's report.
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.


MXCIV - "GHTTOMARCHINRA"

  Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
  He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
  The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
  My lord protector, so it please your grace,
  And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  Comets, importing change of times and states,
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
  Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!


MXCV - "NKSOFBETTEREQU"

  Never went with his forces into France
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
  Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
  Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
  But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


MXCVI - "IPAGEBUTSINCEH"

  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
  And with the same to act controlling laws.
  Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
  Unless he take the course that you have done,
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
  So keen and greedy to confound a man:
  I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.


MXCVII - "EDIEDANDPOETSB"

  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  If ever you have look'd on better days,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Although they wear their faces to the bent
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
  Something about, a little from the right,
  By this I challenge him to single fight.


MXCVIII - "ETTERPROVETHEI"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
  That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?
  Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
  Of such contents as you will wonder at;
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
  His royal self in judgment comes to hear
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.


MXCIX - "RSFORTHEIRSTYL"

  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Since they do better thee in their command.
  Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!


MC - "EILLREADHISFOR"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
  I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
  Sir, I did never win of you before.
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.


MCI - "HISLOVEFULLMAN"

  How joyful am I made by this contract!
  I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  Let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
  Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  For none abides with me: my joy is death;
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
  My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
  A man of complements, whom right and wrong
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MCII - "YAGLORIOUSMORN"

  Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
  And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
  Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
  Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
  Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  It is religion that doth make vows kept;
  Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
  Unless a brother should a brother dare
  Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
  Myself have often heard him say and swear
  Only to flatter fools and make them bold:
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!


MCIII - "INGHAVEISEENFL"

  If what in rest you have in right you hold,
  Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
  Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  If you do censure me by what you were,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!


MCIV - "ATTERTHEMOUNTA"

  A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
  Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
  There is but three skirts for yourself, in my
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
  O, step between her and her fighting soul
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  The confident and over-lusty French
  And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.


MCV - "INTOPSWITHSOVE"

  I will bring in the empress and her sons,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Peace be to England, if that war return
  Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
  Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  The enemy of all your graces lives.
  Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.
  See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MCVI - "REIGNEYEKISSIN"

  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  I am as like to call thee so again,
  Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.
  Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  You shall have letters from me to my son
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  Is as a fury to torment my soul;
  So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  I thought King Henry had resembled thee
  Not that, I hope, which you received of me.


MCVII - "GWITHGOLDENFAC"

  Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
  Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
  I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
  The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:
  Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
  For, as I think, they do command him home,
  And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!
  Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.


MCVIII - "ETHEMEADOWSGRE"

  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.
  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  My will is something sorted with his wish.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
  Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
  Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MCIX - "ENGILDINGPALES"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
  Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
  A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Some men must love my lady and some Joan.


MCX - "TREAMSWITHHEAV"

  The English are embattled, you French peers.
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  And foreign mart for implements of war;
  My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
  So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
  Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
  That I might so have rated my expense,
  Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
  His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


MCXI - "ENLYALCHEMYANO"

  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!


MCXII - "NPERMITTHEBASE"

  No more of this; it does offend my heart:
  Paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
  If I can catch him once upon the hip,
  To eke it and to draw it out in length,
  That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
  His folly to the mettle of my speech?
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
  And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
  Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MCXIII - "STCLOUDSTORIDE"

  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.
  Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
  Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
  Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
  Something I must do to procure me grace.
  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
  Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


MCXIV - "WITHUGLYRACKON"

  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
  I have from their confines call'd to enact
  That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
  Your master wed me to: nothing but death
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair
  Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
  Now for the honour of the forlorn French!


MCXV - "HISCELESTIALFA"

  How he did seem to dive into their hearts
  In a light. Yet you see how this world goes.
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  To what may be digested in a play.
  It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
  And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
  Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
  For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
  Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.


MCXVI - "CEANDFROMTHEFO"

  Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  And then he drew a dial from his poke,
  No part of him but will be shame in me.
  Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
  For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
  He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
  Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.


MCXVII - "RLORNWORLDHISV"

  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  When Richard, with his eye brim full of tears,
  O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MCXVIII - "ISAGEHIDESTEAL"

  I crave the benefit of law of arms.
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Good King, that must approve the common saw,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
  Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Such as I am: though for myself alone
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.


MCXIX - "INGUNSEENTOWES"

  I know I am too mean to be your queen,
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Unless some dull and favourable hand
  Not portable, lie under this report:
  Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
  On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
  With honour of his birthright to the crown.
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Some men must love my lady and some Joan.


MCXX - "TWITHTHISDISGR"

  Though standing naked on a mountain top,
  Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
  Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
  Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
  He says he will return incontinent:
  It is extempore, from my mother wit.
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


MCXXI - "ACEEVENSOMYSUN"

  Are murd'red for our pains. This bitter taste
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  My shame be his that did my fame confound;
  You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Never came poison from so sweet a place.


MCXXII - "ONEEARLYMORNDI"

  O, they did urge it still unto the king!
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
  Of all mad matches, never was the like.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
  I lead espoused my bride along with me.


MCXXIII - "DSHINEWITHALLT"

  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
  He doth object I am too great of birth--,
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
  I prithee go and get me some repast;
  To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
  Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.


MCXXIV - "RIUMPHANTSPLEN"

  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Presents that I intend to send them both:
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.


MCXXV - "DORONMYBROWBUT"

  Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!
  O sacred receptacle of my joys,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  No man so potent breathes upon the ground
  My liege, your highness now may do me good.
  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
  But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
  But this is worshipful society
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  The small'st opinion on my least misuse?


MCXXVI - "OUTALACKHEWASB"

  O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
  Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
  Till after many accents and delays,
  As shall become your highness; where you may
  Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
  And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
  Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
  King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
  Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
  And FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
  Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
  By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.


MCXXVII - "UTONEHOURMINET"

  Upon my wretched women, that so long
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  Or is he but retired to make him strong?
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Must by the hungry now be fed upon:
  I moralize two meanings in one word.
  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.


MCXXVIII - "HEREGIONCLOUDH"

  Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
  Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Upon my lady's missing, came to me
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?


MCXXIX - "ATHMASKDHIMFRO"

  Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
  To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
  Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
  More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,
  Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
  If I may have your daughter to my wife,
  My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
  For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?


MCXXX - "MMENOWYETHIMFO"

  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  O, but I love his lady too too much,
  We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
  You have received your griefs; nor are they such
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:
  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
  My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
  For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.


MCXXXI - "RTHISMYLOVENOW"

  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  If sorrow can admit society,
  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  Your potent and infectious fevers heap
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  On Saturday we will return to France.
  Will very well become a soldier's dance.


MCXXXII - "HITDISDAINETHS"

  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
  Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.
  Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
  Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
  And there did seem in him a kind of joy
  It may be good: pride hath no other glass
  No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
  How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,
  Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?


MCXXXIII - "UNSOFTHEWORLDM"

  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  For love is still most precious in itself;
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Let us with care perform his great behest.
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!


MCXXXIV - "AYSTAINWHENHEA"

  As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
  Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
  Such men as he be never at heart's ease
  Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
  And to obey shall be in me remorse,
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
  He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,
  How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.


MCXXXV - "VENSSUNSTAINET"

  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  Such as I am: though for myself alone
  Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
  Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
  A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To make me blest or cursed'st among men.


MCXXXVI - "HWHYDIDSTTHOUP"

  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
  Why would he for the momentary trick
  His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
  Take with you your companions; as you look
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  Please you draw near. Louder the music there!


MCXXXVII - "ROMISESUCHABEA"

  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
  I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
  Sir, I invite your highness and your train
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
  Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
  Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
  Here sits a king more woful than you are.
  And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
  But thou from loving England art so far,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!


MCXXXVIII - "UTEOUSDAYANDMA"

  Under that colour am I come to scale
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
  Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
  And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
  You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
  And shut myself up in some other course,
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
  And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.


MCXXXIX - "KEMETRAVELFORT"

  Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Like madness is the glory of this life.
  Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  To new-found methods and to compounds strange?


MCXL - "HWITHOUTMYCLOA"

  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  The commons will not then be satisfied.
  More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
  Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!


MCXLI - "KTOLETBASECLOU"

  Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
  The English are embattled, you French peers.
  One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
  Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.


MCXLII - "DSOERTAKEMEINM"

  Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.


MCXLIII - "YWAYHIDINGTHYB"

  Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
  Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
  A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
  Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
  How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
  To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
  He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
  Your faithful service and your toil in war;
  But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.


MCXLIV - "RAVERYINTHEIRR"

  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  That make her good? O, let her brother live!
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  It is thy business that I go about.
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.


MCXLV - "OTTENSMOKETISN"

  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.


MCXLVI - "OTENOUGHTHATTH"

  Of all his wars within the realm of France?
  This was the noblest Roman of them all:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
  O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
  Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
  Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
  How can I then be elder than thou art?


MCXLVII - "ROUGHTHECLOUDT"

  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
  The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
  Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
  O, some authority how to proceed;
  Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
  Things past redress are now with me past care.


MCXLVIII - "HOUBREAKTODRYT"

  How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  The argument all bare is of more worth
  Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
  The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.


MCXLIX - "HERAINONMYSTOR"

  Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  More French: I shall never move thee in French,
  Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MCL - "MBEATENFACEFOR"

  My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  For what I have I need not to repeat;
  And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
  Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  First if all obstacles were cut away,
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MCLI - "NOMANWELLOFSUC"

  Necessity will make us all forsworn
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,
  Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
  Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
  Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
  So that from point to point now have you heard
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?


MCLII - "HASALVECANSPEA"

  How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
  And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  All my reports go with the modest truth;
  Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;
  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  And equity exiled your highness' land.


MCLIII - "KTHATHEALSTHEW"

  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God
  Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  And better in my mind not undertook.
  Lady, you know no rules of charity,
  Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.
  Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.


MCLIV - "OUNDANDCURESNO"

  O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
  Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
  Distract your army, which doth most consist
  Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.


MCLV - "TTHEDISGRACENO"

  There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Give me some music; music, moody food
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.
  Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,
  Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!


MCLVI - "RCANTHYSHAMEGI"

  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
  And let it be confiscate all, so soon
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  Are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
  Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.


MCLVII - "VEPHYSICTOMYGR"

  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
  His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  I was not much afeard; for once or twice
  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
  O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  You love my son; invention is ashamed,
  Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


MCLVIII - "IEFTHOUGHTHOUR"

  I heard no letter from my master since
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
  Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
  Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
  Give me some sack; and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
  How long a time lies in one little word!
  Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  On yon proud man, should take it off again
  Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MCLIX - "EPENTYETIHAVES"

  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  The king hath heard them; to the which as yet
  Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
  I rather would entreat thy company
  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Since the physician at your father's died?


MCLX - "TILLTHELOSSTHE"

  They will digest this harsh indignity.
  It follows then the cat must stay at home:
  Love can transpose to form and dignity:
  Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  However God or fortune cast my lot,
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
  Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  How insolent of late he is become,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MCLXI - "OFFENDERSSORRO"

  O, full of careful business are his looks!
  Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Depose him in the justice of his cause.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
  Spare England, for it is your native coast;
  O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  O any thing, of nothing first create!


MCLXII - "WLENDSBUTWEAKR"

  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Either of king or council, when you went
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
  Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
  But let desert in pure election shine,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
  Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  And reason flies the object of all harm:
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MCLXIII - "ELIEFTOHIMTHAT"

  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
  To die is to be banish'd from myself;
  O let no noble eye profane a tear
  He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
  Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
  And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
  That I would choose, were I to choose anew.


MCLXIV - "BEARSTHESTRONG"

  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
  The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
  Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Something to do with you. Come, you're a young
  Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Not knowing them until we know their grave:
  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!


MCLXV - "OFFENCESCROSSA"

  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  From a resolved and honourable war,
  For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Nor never did my actions yet commence
  Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
  Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  So do the kings of France unto this day;
  Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?


MCLXVI - "HBUTTHOSETEARS"

  How did this offer seem received, my lord?
  But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  There is no world without Verona walls,
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
  O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  A just and open trial. While she lives
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!


MCLXVII - "AREPEARLWHICHT"

  Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Parts that become thee happily enough
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
  His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
  I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
  Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!


MCLXVIII - "HYLOVESHEDSAND"

  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  You are deceived; my child is none of his:
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
  His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.


MCLXIX - "THEYARERICHAND"

  That, by confessing them, the souls of men
  How true a gentleman you send relief,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  And age in love loves not to have years told:
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
  Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.


MCLXX - "RANSOMALLILLDE"

  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  As it is known she is, these moral laws
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
  Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  Let his deservings and my love withal
  Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MCLXXI - "EDSNOMOREBEGRI"

  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
  So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Be pilot to me and thy places shall
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  I think I should have told your grace's tale.


MCLXXII - "EVEDATTHATWHIC"

  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night
  And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;
  To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
  His subjects to oppression and contempt
  Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
  Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?


MCLXXIII - "HTHOUHASTDONER"

  His health was never better worth than now.
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
  O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Neglect the visitation of my friends.
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!


MCLXXIV - "OSESHAVETHORNS"

  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  He finds himself beholding to us all.
  And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.


MCLXXV - "ANDSILVERFOUNT"

  Against infection and the hand of war,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Divide your happy England into four;
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.


MCLXXVI - "AINSMUDCLOUDSA"

  As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
  If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
  My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
  Curate and your sweet self are good at such
  Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
  A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?


MCLXXVII - "NDECLIPSESSTAI"

  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  If broken, then it is no fault of mine.
  Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
  So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
  Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
  That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
  Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
  I like this well; he will return again.


MCLXXVIII - "NBOTHMOONANDSU"

  Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
  Being but the second generation
  O master, master I have watch'd so long
  That tremble at the imagination?
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?


MCLXXIX - "NANDLOATHSOMEC"

  Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
  And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
  Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
  That I, unworthy body as I am,
  Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  One vice, but of a minute old, for one
  My life stands in the level of your dreams,
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.


MCLXXX - "ANKERLIVESINSW"

  A' was a merry man--took up the child:
  No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
  I would have left it on the board so soon
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
  Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.


MCLXXXI - "EETESTBUDALLME"

  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
  Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
  But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Make thee the father of their idle dreams
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MCLXXXII - "NMAKEFAULTSAND"

  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
  Much castigation, exercise devout;
  Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
  And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
  Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.


MCLXXXIII - "EVENIINTHISAUT"

  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  It is religion that doth make vows kept;
  I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
  He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
  Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
  So to the laws at large I write my name:
  And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  That I may venture to depart alone.


MCLXXXIV - "HORIZINGTHYTRE"

  He took my father grossly, full of bread,
  Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
  I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Good friends for three reprieves for you and your
  That she with painted images hath spent;
  How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
  You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
  The other to enjoy by rage and war:
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MCLXXXV - "SPASSWITHCOMPA"

  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.
  Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
  And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
  So I might have your company in hell,
  Small time, but in that small most greatly lived
  Which three till now never kept seat in one.
  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  That in your knowledge may by me be done,
  He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  Of this great sport together, as you guess?
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  A guard of patience: stay a little while.


MCLXXXVI - "REMYSELFCORRUP"

  Receive the sentence of the law for sins
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
  Yes, something you can deny for your own
  Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.
  Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  Of all the court and princes of my blood:
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
  Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.


MCLXXXVII - "TINGSALVINGTHY"

  To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
  Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
  Her aid she promised and assured success:
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.


MCLXXXVIII - "AMISSEXCUSINGT"

  As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
 eXceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
  I see you what you are, you are too proud;
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
  Till the prince came, who parted either part.


MCLXXXIX - "HYSINSMORETHAN"

  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
  So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
  Making not reservation of yourselves,
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.


MCXC - "THYSINSAREFORT"

  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
  So he were like him and by Venus' side.
  I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
  Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
  Such are the poor, in health--or else a feast,
  And I confess besides I am no maid:
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  For with the nightly linen that she wears
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Therefore I do advise you take this note.


MCXCI - "OTHYSENSUALFAU"

  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
  Sticking together in calamity.
  Until it wither with me to my grave
  And whirl along with thee about the globe.
  Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
  For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
  And with the vantage of mine own excuse
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?


MCXCII - "LTIBRINGINSENS"

  Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
  That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
  I do pronounce him in that very shape
  But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  If they were known, as the suspect is great,
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
  Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
  Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!


MCXCIII - "ETHYADVERSEPAR"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  To have it added to the faults of mine,
  Happy in this, she is not yet so old
  Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
  Among fresh female buds shall you this night
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  So am I now: O no, that cannot be;
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
  As, painfully to pore upon a book
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MCXCIV - "TYISTHYADVOCAT"

  Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
  I'll get me one of such another length.
  Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
  How joyful am I made by this contract!
  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Or, being open, put into his hands
  Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
  And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
  The better that your lordship please to ask.


MCXCV - "EANDGAINSTMYSE"

  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Noble philosopher, your company.
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  My chaplain to no creature living, but
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MCXCVI - "LFALAWFULPLEAC"

  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
  Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  Let me be no assistant for a state,
  Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
  Let it command a mirror hither straight,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  And I will wish thee never more to dance,
  Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?


MCXCVII - "OMMENCESUCHCIV"

  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
  More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
  Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
  How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
  Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
  I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MCXCVIII - "ILWARISINMYLOV"

  I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
  Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
  Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.
  And a true lover of the holy church.
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
  You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Or in my life what comfort, when I am
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


MCXCIX - "EANDHATETHATIA"

  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  And such an instrument I was to use.
  Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
  According to the statute of the town,
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
  That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.


MCC - "NACCESSARYNEED"

  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  And more, much more. The time will bring it out.
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
  Can change their moons and bring their times about
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
  As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  You are but newly planted in your throne;
  Now one the better, then another best;
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?


MCCI - "SMUSTBETOTHATS"

  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  But not without that harmful stroke which since
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  The one of them contains my picture, prince:
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  To your protection I commend me, gods.
  He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
  These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
  So to be valiant is no praise at all.


MCCII - "WEETTHIEFWHICH"

  With other princes that may best be spared,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
  The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
  What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.


MCCIII - "SOURLYROBSFROM"

  Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
  Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  From whom my absence was not six months old
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  On what submissive message art thou sent?
  My sighs and tears and will not once relent?


MCCIV - "MELETMECONFESS"

  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Too little payment for so great a debt.
  My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
  O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
  For this effect defective comes by cause.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
  Sister, content you in my discontent.


MCCV - "THATWETWOMUSTB"

  Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
  Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
  And with a larger tether may he walk
  The face, that map which deep impression bears
  What must the king do now? must he submit?
  Either of king or council, when you went
  To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
  Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
  Of noble blood in this declining land.
  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
  Unless some dull and favourable hand
  So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
  But did you not request to have it cut?


MCCVI - "ETWAINALTHOUGH"

  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  The basin that receives your guilty blood.
  Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
  As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
  Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
  A light condition in a beauty dark.
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  To cipher me how fondly I did dote;
  Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
  Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
  Here is a silly stately style indeed!


MCCVII - "OURUNDIVIDEDLO"

  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Until you see her die again; for then
  Now cheer each other in each other's love
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  I do remember how my father said
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Deny your asking: take your choice of those
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.


MCCVIII - "VESAREONESOSHA"

  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
  No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
  Other course you please, which the time shall more
  So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  And shall the same give pardon to a slave?


MCCIX - "LLTHOSEBLOTSTH"

  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  But thou didst understand me by my signs
  Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
  On purpose shut the doors against his way.
  They burn in indignation. I repent:
  She bade good night that kept my rest away;
  Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
  Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.


MCCX - "ATDOWITHMEREMA"

  A couching lion and a ramping cat,
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  Defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
  Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
  Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
  I guess one angel in another's hell;
  They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
  Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!


MCCXI - "INWITHOUTTHYHE"

  I am not barren to bring forth complaints
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Which out of daily fortune ever taints
  I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal
  Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
  Under the service of a child as soon
  The consequence is then thy jealous fits
  The precious jewel of thy home return.
  Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MCCXII - "LPBYMEBEBORNEA"

  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
  But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
  Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
  My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  But we are spirits of another sort:
  Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.


MCCXIII - "LONEINOURTWOLO"

  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
  Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  Within the limit of becoming mirth,
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!


MCCXIV - "VESTHEREISBUTO"

  Values itself so highly that to her
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
  Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
  Between whose endless jar justice resides,
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!


MCCXV - "NERESPECTTHOUG"

  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Call for the music in the other room.
  That he his high authority abused,
  Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!


MCCXVI - "HINOURLIVESASE"

  Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul
  I will consider; what you have to say
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Open your gates and gives the victors way.
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
  In the dark backward and abysm of time?
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  And send him word by me which way you go.
  Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MCCXVII - "PARABLESPITEWH"

  Put but a little water in a spoon,
  And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Presence must be the whip of the other.
  I will converse with iron-witted fools
  That Edward is escaped from your brother,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  With gentle travail, to the gladding of
  Her that so wishes and her humble love!


MCCXVIII - "ICHTHOUGHITALT"

  Is partly to behold my lady's face;
  Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
  His company must do his minions grace,
  That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
  He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
  O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,
  Here is my hand; the premises observed,
  I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
  Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  To be commenced in strands afar remote.


MCCXIX - "ERNOTLOVESSOLE"

  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Or by the father there were none at all;
  Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
  She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Loyalty, something fears me to think of.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MCCXX - "EFFECTYETDOTHI"

  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  First, in this forest let us do those ends
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
  To endless date of never-ending woes?
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
  Deliver him to safety; and return,
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
  This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
  How often said, my dignity would last
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.


MCCXXI - "TSTEALSWEETHOU"

  Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
  Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  And knows not how to do it but with tears.
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
  With modesty admiring thy renown,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  That would hang us, every mother's son.
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Or whether revolution be the same.
  Using no other weapon but his name.


MCCXXII - "RSFROMLOVESDEL"

  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  She bids me think how I have been forsworn
  For I have bills for money by exchange
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Must have inventions to delight the taste,
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.


MCCXXIII - "IGHTIMAYNOTEVE"

  If this but answer to my just belief,
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
  To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
  I shall be well content with any choice
  Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
  And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.
  Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
  No messenger, but thine; and all alone
  Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
  That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MCCXXIV - "RMOREACKNOWLED"

  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  My speech should fall into such vile success
  Of what is to continue: never mind
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
  Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.


MCCXXV - "GETHEELESTMYBE"

  Great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
  Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  So is it in the music of men's lives.
  The labour of each knight in his device.
  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


MCCXXVI - "WAILEDGUILTSHO"

  We cannot feel too little, hear too much.
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  In my most ill-composed affection such
  Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
  Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
  To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
  Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.


MCCXXVII - "ULDDOTHEESHAME"

  Unto the brother of your loving bride;
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
  Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
  He gave his honours to the world again,
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MCCXXVIII - "NORTHOUWITHPUB"

  Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
  Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  To make such means for her as thou hast done
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  What if my house be troubled with a rat
  I will be thine; and till that instant shut
  These English woes will make me smile in France.
  Have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
  Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.


MCCXXIX - "LICKINDNESSHON"

  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  I all alone beweep my outcast state
  Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
  Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
  If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Say they be fled; Germans are honest men.
  Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
  Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
  Of fool and feather that they got in France,
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.


MCCXXX - "OURMEUNLESSTHO"

  O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
  Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
  Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
  Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.


MCCXXXI - "UTAKETHATHONOU"

  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
  Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
  The commons will not then be satisfied.
  How much you were my conqueror; and that
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Or whether revolution be the same.
  Using no other weapon but his name.


MCCXXXII - "RFROMTHYNAMEBU"

  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  That labour on the bosom of this sphere
  Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
  Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  And, in a word, but even now worth this,
  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  But what says she to me? be brief, my good
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!


MCCXXXIII - "TDONOTSOILOVET"

  This packet, please it you, contains at large.
  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  If one good deed in all my life I did,
  Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Than both your poets can in praise devise.


MCCXXXIV - "HEEINSUCHSORTA"

  Here stand a pair of honourable men;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  It should be now, but that my fear is this,
  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
  How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
  So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
  Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.
  Retaining but a quantity of life,
  Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
  And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.


MCCXXXV - "STHOUBEINGMINE"

  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  That love the fundamental part of state
  He has borne all things well: and I do think
  O God! that one might read the book of fate,
  Until thy head be circled with the same.
  Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MCCXXXVI - "MINEISTHYGOODR"

  Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
  I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
  Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
  Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
  Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  Grow great by your example and put on
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!


MCCXXXVII - "EPORTASADECREP"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  To join your hearts in love and amity.
  And all my honest faith in thee is lost,
  Sticking together in calamity.
  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Please you draw near. Louder the music there!


MCCXXXVIII - "ITFATHERTAKESD"

  I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  That no supporter but the huge firm earth
  And thou art wedded to calamity.
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!


MCCXXXIX - "ELIGHTTOSEEHIS"

  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
  I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains
  Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  This morning are they fled away and gone;
  That in the way of loyalty and truth
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Either to get the town again or die:
  He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
  If at Philippi we do face him there,
  Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.


MCCXL - "ACTIVECHILDDOD"

  All kinds of arguments and question deep,
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
  How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
  I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
  Like witless antics, one another meet,
  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
  Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.


MCCXLI - "EEDSOFYOUTHSOI"

  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
  Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  You would have thought the very windows spake,
  Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
  Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
  Of this escape and whither they are bound;
  I have done so, but he's not to be found.


MCCXLII - "MADELAMEBYFORT"

  Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
  A beast, to bear every knave's wrong.
  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
  You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,
  For such as I am all true lovers are,
  On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.


MCCXLIII - "UNESDEARESTSPI"

  Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  So like to him that got it, if thou hast
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  The care I had and have of subjects' good
  Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
  Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
  Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!


MCCXLIV - "TETAKEALLMYCOM"

  Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
  Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
  You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.


MCCXLV - "FORTOFTHYWORTH"

  Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
  Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:
  We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
  Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  He speaks not like a man of God's making.


MCCXLVI - "ANDTRUTHFORWHE"

  Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
  The manner how this action hath been borne
  Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
  Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
  O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Wherein my sword had not impressure made
  Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MCCXLVII - "THERBEAUTYBIRT"

  The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  By'r lady, he is a good musician.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  And say you do't by our permission;
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
  In doing courtesies, and one in whom
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?


MCCXLVIII - "HORWEALTHORWIT"

  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  As I intend more good to you and yours,
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Have they been merry! which their keepers call
  O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  To revel in the entrails of my lambs.


MCCXLIX - "ORANYOFTHESEAL"

  O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  And now at length they overflow their banks.
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  You are so strongly in my purpose bred
  Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
  For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
  That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
  How shall I honour thee for this success?
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Success and conquest to attend on us.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
  Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?


MCCL - "LORALLORMOREEN"

  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  And show thee all the treasure we have got,
  Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
  Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
  Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  No; let my father seek another heir.


MCCLI - "TITLEDINTHYPAR"

  They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
  In whose comparison all whites are ink,
  The extreme parts of time extremely forms
  Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,
  Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.


MCCLII - "TSDOCROWNEDSIT"

  That if it would but apprehend some joy,
  She, silly queen, with more than love's good will,
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  I will not reason what is meant hereby,
  Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.


MCCLIII - "IMAKEMYLOVEENG"

  Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
  My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
  You understand me not that tell me so:
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.


MCCLIV - "RAFTEDTOTHISST"

  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
  Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
  O, had the monster seen those lily hands
  The dearer by I know how much an ounce.
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
  Such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
  This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.


MCCLV - "ORESOTHENIAMNO"

  On pain of death, no person be so bold
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  O, throw away the worser part of it,
  This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
  His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  If you think meet, this afternoon will post
  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
  My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.


MCCLVI - "TLAMEPOORNORDE"

  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  And to fulfil his prince' desire,
  Means to immure herself and not be seen.
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MCCLVII - "SPISEDWHILSTTH"

  Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
  Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
  I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
  Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Doing the execution and the act
  Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
  How joyful am I made by this contract!
  Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
  Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
  Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
  There is no malice in this burning coal;
  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
  His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.


MCCLVIII - "ATTHISSHADOWDO"

  A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  The ample proposition that hope makes
  Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
  I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
  Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
  Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
  O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!


MCCLIX - "THSUCHSUBSTANC"

  That labour may you save: see where he comes.
  He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
  She shall be habited as it becomes
  Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
  Contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
  His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
  Some happy mean to end a hapless life.
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
  Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
  Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
  A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
  Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
  Come, let me see what task I have to do.


MCCLX - "EGIVETHATIINTH"

  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
  In having known no travel in his youth.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  And interchangeably set down their hands,
  To show how quaint an orator you are:
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  If on my credit you dare build so far
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?


MCCLXI - "YABUNDANCEAMSU"

  You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
  Before my God, I might not this believe
  Under these hard conditions as this time
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  And plant in tyrants mild humility.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
  More should I question thee, and more I must,
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?


MCCLXII - "FFICEDANDBYAPA"

  Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
  For we were subjects but while you were king.
  I cannot make you what amends I would,
  Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  And, not without some scandal to yourself,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
  Your gracious self to take on you the charge
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.


MCCLXIII - "RTOFALLTHYGLOR"

  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
  Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
  From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
  A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
  Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
  Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
  Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
  Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.


MCCLXIV - "YLIVELOOKWHATI"

  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  Let him alone, for I remember now
  It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
  How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
  Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
  That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
  It shall be what o'clock I say it is.


MCCLXV - "SBESTTHATBESTI"

  Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
  But when contention and occasion meet,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
  To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
  This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
  Have of their puissance made a little taste.
  And says that once more I shall interchange
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  But did you not request to have it cut?
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
  I cannot be much lower than my knees.


MCCLXVI - "WISHINTHEETHIS"

  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
  Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  The fountain from the which my current runs,
  He would not answer to: forbad all names;
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Their bodies to the lust of English youth
  Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
  It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.


MCCLXVII - "WISHIHAVETHENT"

  Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
  If this be error and upon me proved,
  So two, together weeping, make one woe.
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
  Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.


MCCLXVIII - "ENTIMESHAPPYME"

  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
  My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Her brother is in secret come from France;
  As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  Pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
  You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
  Might be affronted with the match and weight
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MCCLXIX - "HOWCANMYMUSEWA"

  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
  You have a noble and a true conceit
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
  Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
  Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.


MCCLXX - "NTSUBJECTTOINV"

  No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
  Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
  Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  But with as humble lowliness of mind
  Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
  O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


MCCLXXI - "ENTWHILETHOUDO"

  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
  Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
  Is found a truth now: for it grows again
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.


MCCLXXII - "STBREATHETHATP"

  Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
  But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  As the death-bed whereon it must expire
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  And to proclaim it civilly, were like
  Then let your will attend on their accords.
  Poor we may call them in their native lords.


MCCLXXIII - "OURSTINTOMYVER"

  Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;
  O noble judge! O excellent young man!
  Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff
  You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.


MCCLXXIV - "SETHINEOWNSWEE"

  Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
  Her best is better'd with a more delight.
  If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
  Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
  No other obligation! By my life,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MCCLXXV - "TARGUMENTTOOEX"

  To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
  A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
  Unto the legions on the other side.
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  That from it all consideration slips!
  Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
 eXcept to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MCCLXXVI - "CELLENTFOREVER"

  Could witness it, for he was with me then;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again
  Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
  That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
  For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MCCLXXVII - "YVULGARPAPERTO"

  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  Let it be who it is: for Romans now
  Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
  A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!
  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  Each day still better other's happiness;
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
  Of his bright passage to the occident.


MCCLXXVIII - "REHEARSEOGIVET"

  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
  I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.


MCCLXXIX - "HYSELFTHETHANK"

  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.
  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
  To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
  How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
  Hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Neither of either; I remit both twain.
  Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.


MCCLXXX - "SIFAUGHTINMEWO"

  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
  Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
  And who cannot abuse a body dead?
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
  That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
  I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
  Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
  Making a famine where abundance lies,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


MCCLXXXI - "RTHYPERUSALSTA"

  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
  Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
  You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
  Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
  That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
  As more at large your grace shall understand.


MCCLXXXII - "NDAGAINSTTHYSI"

  Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
  Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
  As more at large your grace shall understand.
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
  That I would set my lie on any chance,
  The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
  His father revell'd in the heart of France,
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  Say I am merry: come to me again,
  I shall be glad to learn of noble men.


MCCLXXXIII - "GHTFORWHOSSODU"

  Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  He entertain'd a show so seeming just,
  There is a gentleman that serves the count
  For which I would not plead, but that I must;
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
  Her face the book of praises, where is read
  Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Should hold up high in brass, and such again
  Or shall we sparingly show you far off
  Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.


MCCLXXXIV - "MBTHATCANNOTWR"

  Methinks I should not thus be led along,
  But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
  That policy may either last so long,
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
  That the precipitation might down stretch
  Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
  And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
  Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MCCLXXXV - "ITETOTHEEWHENT"

  In no less working than are swords and bows
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--
  Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.


MCCLXXXVI - "HOUTHYSELFDOST"

  How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
  Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
  Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
  Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!


MCCLXXXVII - "GIVEINVENTIONL"

  Got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
  In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.


MCCLXXXVIII - "IGHTBETHOUTHET"

  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
  Being mechanical, you ought not walk
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  The due of honour in no point omit.


MCCLXXXIX - "ENTHMUSETENTIM"

  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  He never was so womanish; the cause
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
  Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.


MCCXC - "ESMOREINWORTHT"

  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  She would not lose it: her attendants are
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  I had no judgment when to her I swore.
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
  One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!
  To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.
  Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
  This packet, please it you, contains at large.


MCCXCI - "HANTHOSEOLDNIN"

  Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
  And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
  He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  If then thy spirit look upon us now,
  Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.


MCCXCII - "EWHICHRHYMERSI"

  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
  Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  Have by the very cunning of the scene
  You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.


MCCXCIII - "NVOCATEANDHETH"

  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  On either side I come to spend my breath;
  Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
  And he, the noble image of my youth,
  The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
  Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  That in a Christian climate souls refined
  He says they can do nothing in this kind.


MCCXCIV - "ATCALLSONTHEEL"

  A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
  Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
  Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
  Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
  Let me go grind their bones to powder small
  Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
  The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.


MCCXCV - "ETHIMBRINGFORT"

  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
  He hath brought many captives home to Rome
  I do beweep to many simple gulls
  Myself, as far as I could well discern
  By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  I like your silence, it the more shows off
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
  For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
  Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
  Returns with precious jading to the bay
  Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.


MCCXCVI - "HETERNALNUMBER"

  Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  A man already made, as to remit
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
  Brother of England, how may we content
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.


MCCXCVII - "STOOUTLIVELONG"

  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  The story that is printed in her blood?
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  That in their kind they speak it: only sin
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  I pull in resolution, and begin
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
  No matter whither, so you come not here.
  Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.


MCCXCVIII - "DATEIFMYSLIGHT"

  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
  My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
  Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
  Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
  Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:
  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
  How have you made division of yourself?
  That I have much ado to know myself.


MCCXCIX - "MUSEDOPLEASETH"

  Methought I had; and often did I strive
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Shall as a pattern or a measure live
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
  Posterity, await for wretched years,
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  And pray thee take this mercy to provide
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
  Have I not reason to prefer mine own?


MCCC - "ESECURIOUSDAYS"

  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Seditious to his grace and to the state.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
  Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
  Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
  Your lord and master did well to make his
  Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.


MCCCI - "THEPAINBEMINEB"

  The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
  Hath willingly departed with a part,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
  And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
  I see a better state to me belongs
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
  I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.


MCCCII - "UTTHINESHALLBE"

  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Those that would die or ere resist are grown
  Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
  Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  No less in pity than his glory which
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head;
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


MCCCIII - "THEPRAISEOHOWT"

  The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
  Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
  I came unto your court for honour's cause,
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
  Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
  These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.


MCCCIV - "HYWORTHWITHMAN"

  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  That tremble at the imagination?
  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
  Were't not that, by great preservation,
  In all her best array bear her to church:
  That he would labour my delivery.
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  My lodging out. Give him a livery
  And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.


MCCCV - "NERSMAYISINGWH"

  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  My chaplain to no creature living, but
  A light condition in a beauty dark.
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
  Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
  Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
  I may not go without you to the kings.
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
  Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.


MCCCVI - "ENTHOUARTALLTH"

  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
  He would not answer to: forbad all names;
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Attend your office and your quality.
  Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
  The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
  A mighty and a fearful head they are,
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
  This sound of hope doth labour to expel;
  Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.


MCCCVII - "EBETTERPARTOFM"

  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
  They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  From thee to die were torture more than death:
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.


MCCCVIII - "EWHATCANMINEOW"

  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Why should we in the compass of a pale
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
  To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
  Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
  And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  My love with words and errors still she feeds;
  Is business of estate; in which we come
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  What is thy name? I know thy quality.


MCCCIX - "NPRAISETOMINEO"

  Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
  Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
  In all which time you and your husband Grey
  She shall not long continue love to him.
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,
  More upon humour than advised respect.
  I must be cruel, only to be kind;
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?


MCCCX - "WNSELFBRINGAND"

  Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
  Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Looking before and after, gave us not
  Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
  But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  And hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Depose him in the justice of his cause.


MCCCXI - "WHATISTBUTMINE"

  We'll show thee Io as she was a maid
  Here at my house and at my proper cost.
  And I had many living to upbraid
  That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
  I long to know the truth hereof at large.
  So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
  That yarely frame the office. From the barge
  Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
  My mother is assailed in our tent,
  It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MCCCXII - "OWNWHENIPRAISE"

  O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
  What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
  Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
  When it is mingled with regards that stands
  How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  In sight of England and her lordly peers,
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MCCCXIII - "THEEEVENFORTHI"

  These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:
  Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,
  For the base matter to illuminate
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
  The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
  How she opposes her against my will
  In the world, if a' could get her good-will.


MCCCXIV - "SLETUSDIVIDEDL"

  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Seeming to bury that posterity
  Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
  It is no sin at all, but charity.
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  If sad and merry madness equal be.
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.


MCCCXV - "IVEANDOURDEARL"

  If that thy father live, let him repent
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And never from this palace of dim night
  Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.


MCCCXVI - "OVELOSENAMEOFS"

  O, had the monster seen those lily hands
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
  And salt too little which may season give
  Master, your love must live a maid at home;
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
  Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.


MCCCXVII - "INGLEONETHATBY"

  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
  The mariners say how thou hast disposed
  But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
  You should enter, if your trade be to her.


MCCCXVIII - "THISSEPARATION"

  The king shall be contented: must he lose
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  I think there is not half a kiss to choose
  So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
  She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  And better in my mind not undertook.
  Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
  I must be patient till the heavens look
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.


MCCCXIX - "IMAYGIVETHATDU"

  I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
  More should I question thee, and more I must,
  And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
  If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Her highness is in safety, fear you not:
  And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
  That thou so many princes at a shot
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?


MCCCXX - "ETOTHEEWHICHTH"

  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
  Her father means she shall be all in white,
  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,
  He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
  Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
  Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?


MCCCXXI - "OUDESERVESTALO"

  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  To order peace between them; and omit
  And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
  Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
  O any thing, of nothing first create!


MCCCXXII - "NEOABSENCEWHAT"

  Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
  And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
  But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  We must awake endavour for defence;
  How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
  And make the Douglas' son your only mean
  True colours, and not ourselves be seen?


MCCCXXIII - "ATORMENTWOULDS"

  As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.
  The aim of all is but to nurse the life
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  More should I question thee, and more I must,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
  We will unite the white rose and the red:
  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?


MCCCXXIV - "TTHOUPROVEWERE"

  There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
  Thy letters have transported me beyond
  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MCCCXXV - "ITNOTTHYSOURLE"

  I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
  To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
  Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  Some that will thank you, making just report
  O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MCCCXXVI - "ISUREGAVESWEET"

  I know but of a single part, in aught
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  And to proclaim it civilly, were like
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
  Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.


MCCCXXVII - "LEAVETOENTERTA"

  Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  As well descended as thyself; and hath
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
  That no man enter till my tale be done.
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
  And buried once, why not upon my head?


MCCCXXVIII - "INTHETIMEWITHT"

  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
  Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
  That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  The fairest queen that ever king received.
  It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught:
  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  To tell this story, that you might excuse
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  To new-found methods and to compounds strange?


MCCCXXIX - "HOUGHTSOFLOVEW"

  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
  Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
  For these known evils, but to give me leave,
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  What say these young ones? What say you my niece?


MCCCXXX - "HICHTIMEANDTHO"

  His honesty rewards him in itself;
  If I depart from thee, I cannot live;
  Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
  His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
  I owe him little duty, and less love;
  Makes him oppose himself against his king.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?


MCCCXXXI - "UGHTSSOSWEETLY"

  Unmeritable shuns your high request.
  Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
  Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
  This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
  So then two bosoms and a single troth.
  Since that the truest issue of thy throne
  O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
  Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
  Which we much rather had depart withal
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
  Let fair humanity abhor the deed
  You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?


MCCCXXXII - "DOTHDECEIVEAND"

  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  Hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  Do execution on my flesh and blood.


MCCCXXXIII - "THATTHOUTEACHE"

  That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
  Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.
  A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
  Then after to her father will I break;
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  How irksome is this music to my heart!
  Of our restored love and amity.
  Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  And so much less of shame in me remains,
  Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


MCCCXXXIV - "STHOWTOMAKEONE"

  Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
  The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
  He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
  My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
  And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


MCCCXXXV - "TWAINBYPRAISIN"

  Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
  We four indeed confronted were with four
  And by the royalties of both your bloods,
  If you had sent but two hours before,--
  No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
  But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
  You of my household, leave this peevish broil
  Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  And lastly, to confirm that amity
  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
  Sticking together in calamity.
  If Henry were recall'd to life again,
  Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.


MCCCXXXVI - "GHIMHEREWHODOT"

  Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
  Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
  I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
  Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  We do condemn thee to the very block
  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  That,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.


MCCCXXXVII - "HHENCEREMAINTA"

  He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
  Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  CORIOLANUS!
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
  Into the channel, till the lowest stream
  Not possible; for who shall bear your part
  There stay until the twelve celestial signs
  Appointed to direct these fair designs.


MCCCXXXVIII - "KEALLMYLOVESMY"

  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  All things in common nature should produce
  Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
  Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
  My frail mortality to know itself,
  You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
  Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.


MCCCXXXIX - "LOVEYEATAKETHE"

  Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  As jewels purchased at an easy price;
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
  Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MCCCXL - "MALLWHATHASTTH"

  More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
  And may it be that you have quite forgot
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  Like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
  When one but of my ordinance stood up
  How like the prodigal doth she return,
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  Have no perfection of my summer left,
  As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
  To quicken your increase, I will beget
  That I have much ado to know myself.
  Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.


MCCCXLI - "OUTHENMORETHAN"

  Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  The other yet may rise against their force.
  Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  More fierce and more inexorable far
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
  And, in good time! now will we break with him.
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.


MCCCXLII - "THOUHADSTBEFOR"

  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  He sends ye not to murder me for this
  One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
  Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
  She's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
  Being Leonatus, doth import so much.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
  O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MCCCXLIII - "ENOLOVEMYLOVET"

  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
  Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.


MCCCXLIV - "HATTHOUMAYSTTR"

  Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
  And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
  This is a strange repose, to be asleep
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
  Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
  And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!


MCCCXLV - "UELOVECALLALLM"

  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
  And fly would Talbot never, though he might.
  Let us with care perform his great behest.
  Let each man render me his bloody hand:
  And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Many will swoon when they do look on blood.


MCCCXLVI - "INEWASTHINEBEF"

  If all were minded so, the times should cease
  Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  He calls me to a restitution large
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.


MCCCXLVII - "ORETHOUHADSTTH"

  O, had the monster seen those lily hands
  Replies her husband: 'do not take away
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
  Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
  He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth
  And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
  Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
  Surely, by all the glory you have won,
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?


MCCCXLVIII - "ISMORETHENIFFO"

  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Such a dependency of thing on thing,
  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
  O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
  Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
  For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!


MCCCXLIX - "RMYLOVETHOUMYL"

  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
  You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
  Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  Let him have all the rigor of the law.


MCCCL - "OVERECEIVESTIC"

  Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Consisting equally of horse and foot;
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.


MCCCLI - "ANNOTBLAMETHEE"

  As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
  To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
  By laboursome petition, and at last
  Let them want nothing that my house affords.
  And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
  My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
  How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MCCCLII - "FORMYLOVETHOUU"

  For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
  Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  How much I have disabled mine estate,
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.


MCCCLIII - "SESTBUTYETBEBL"

  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
  The fishermen that walk upon the beach
  But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
  Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
  The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  But if I were as wise as honest, then
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.


MCCCLIV - "AMEDIFTHOUTHYS"

  Attested by the holy close of lips,
  Must take up us. So is the unfirm King
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  I will proclaim my name about the field:
  Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
  Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;
  Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
  Our whole city is much bound to him.
  Under a cloak that is of any length.
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?


MCCCLV - "ELFDECEIVESTBY"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Let in that amity which you have made;
  For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  In the division of each several crime,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
  By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.


MCCCLVI - "WILFULTASTEOFW"

  Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
  I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
  Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
  To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
  For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
  What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?


MCCCLVII - "HATTHYSELFREFU"

  His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
  They will digest this harsh indignity.
  To accessary yieldings, but still pure
  Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  For making him egregiously an ass
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.


MCCCLVIII - "SESTIDOFORGIVE"

  She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
  There is no more but so: say it is done,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
  Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
  In private will I talk with thee apart.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MCCCLIX - "THYROBBERYGENT"

  There had she not been long, but she became
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  York set him on to fight and die in shame,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
  Because it is a customary cross,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  You'ld venture an emballing: I myself
  God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  No princely commendations to my king?
  Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!


MCCCLX - "LETHIEFALTHOUG"

  Lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
  Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
  I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
  As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.
  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
  Only thus much I give your grace to know:
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.


MCCCLXI - "HTHOUSTEALTHEE"

  How calm and gentle I proceeded still
  Their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
  Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
  To their approvers they are people such
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  A meaner than myself; since I myself
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  The man that hath no music in himself,
  Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MCCCLXII - "ALLMYPOVERTYAN"

  A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
  Let Antony look over Caesar's head
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.
  You have but jested with me all this while.
  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
  Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.


MCCCLXIII - "DYETLOVEKNOWSI"

  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Two glasses, where herself herself beheld
  Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
  Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
  No part of him but will be shame in me.
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  We shall be late else; which I would not be,
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  I'll do thee service for so good a gift.


MCCCLXIV - "TISAGREATERGRI"

  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
  Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
  And in a dark and dankish vault at home
  Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  And, which is more, she is not so divine,
  The soldiers' music and the rites of war
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  I saw him once. He was a goodly king.


MCCCLXV - "EFTOBEARLOVESW"

  Either to get the town again or die:
  From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
  The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
  Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
  But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  A Roman and a British ensign wave
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.


MCCCLXVI - "RONGTHANHATESK"

  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  And far the weaker with so strong a fear:
  The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Shall win the wager which we will propose.
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.


MCCCLXVII - "NOWNINJURYLASC"

  No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  In the division of each several crime,
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
  Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.


MCCCLXVIII - "IVIOUSGRACEINW"

  Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Or thy precedent services are all
  Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
  So nightly toils the subject of the land,
  Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
  Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand
  And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
  Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
  Not of this country, though my chance is now
  What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?


MCCCLXIX - "HOMALLILLWELLS"

  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
  And do not spread the compost on the weeds
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Love is your master, for he masters you:
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!


MCCCLXX - "HOWSKILLMEWITH"

  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  One poor retiring minute in an age
  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
  Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
  Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Would they not wish the feast might ever last,
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
  Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?


MCCCLXXI - "SPITESYETWEMUS"

  Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
  Than think that we before have heard them told.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
  Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;
  England, bound in with the triumphant sea
  My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  Still live they and for ever may they last!


MCCCLXXII - "TNOTBEFOESTHOS"

  The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  That virtue must go through. We must not stint
  By whom this great assembly is contrived,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  For many years thought dead, are now revived,
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
  The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
  So far from cheer and from your former state.


MCCCLXXIII - "EPETTYWRONGSTH"

  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  The house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?


MCCCLXXIV - "ATLIBERTYCOMMI"

  Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill
  To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
  Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,
  If that the devil and mischance look big
  Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Think, how thou stab'dst me in my prime of youth
  Your sovereign greatness and authority.
  Carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
  Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
  I'll get me one of such another length.


MCCCLXXV - "TSWHENIAMSOMET"

  Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
  Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
  Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
  In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
  Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
  My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.


MCCCLXXVI - "IMEABSENTFROMT"

  It does abhor me now I speak the word;
  Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.
  But that one half which is unsatisfied,
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
  For emulation hath a thousand sons
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  That's he that was Othello: here I am.


MCCCLXXVII - "HYHEARTTHYBEAU"

  His spell in that is out: the king hath found
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  His mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
  Even for this let us divided live,
  And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
  But bring they what they will and what they can,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.


MCCCLXXVIII - "TYANDTHYYEARSF"

  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
  And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
  His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan
  Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
  Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  Fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.


MCCCLXXIX - "ULLWELLBEFITSF"

  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.
  If he could burn us all into one coal,
  They have been violent to me and mine.
  Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
  For lovers ever run before the clock.


MCCCLXXX - "ORSTILLTEMPTAT"

  O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
  That with the hurly death itself awakes?
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
  The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
  And strip myself to death, as to a bed
  To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.


MCCCLXXXI - "IONFOLLOWSWHER"

  I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
  Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
  O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
  What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
  She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
  While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
  He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MCCCLXXXII - "ETHOUARTGENTLE"

  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  To chase these pagans in those holy fields
  Got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MCCCLXXXIII - "THOUARTANDTHER"

  Than prosecute the meanest or the best
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
  The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MCCCLXXXIV - "EFORETOBEWONBE"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  But then AEneas bare a living load,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Which must be done by praising me as much
  Of many worthy fellows that were out;
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  But if you hold it fit, after the play
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MCCCLXXXV - "AUTEOUSTHOUART"

  Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  To him one of the other twins was bound,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
  Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
  Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.


MCCCLXXXVI - "THEREFORETOBEA"

  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
  Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Either to get the town again or die:
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
  Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.


MCCCLXXXVII - "SSAILEDANDWHEN"

  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  She either gives a stomach and no food-
  As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
  In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
  Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
  And with the vantage of mine own excuse
  Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Will bring this labour to an happy end.
  Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  No, madam; we will bring you on your way.


MCCCLXXXVIII - "AWOMANWOOSWHAT"

  Are not thine own so proper as to waste
  What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
  And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
  Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
  Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
  As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
  The king is moved, and answers not to this.


MCCCLXXXIX - "WOMANSSONWILLS"

  Were better than a churlish turf of France.
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  May any terms acquit me from this chance?
  As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
  When this same lusty gentleman was got.
  It is enough you know; and it is fit,
  Looking before and after, gave us not
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Should of another therefore be abused!


MCCCXC - "OURLYLEAVEHERT"

  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
  You are transported by calamity
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
  England and France might, through their amity,
  And--God consigning to my good intents-
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!
  That makes calamity of so long life.


MCCCXCI - "ILLSHEHAVEPREV"

  I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Again in pity of my hard distress
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MCCCXCII - "AILEDAYMEBUTYE"

  A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
  In thine own person answer thy abuse.
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  And better conquest never canst thou make
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MCCCXCIII - "TTHOUMIGHTESTM"

  Thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
  The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  More than his singularity, he goes
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  God's benison go with you; and with those
  Half of the number that King Priam had,
  Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
  Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.


MCCCXCIV - "YSEATFORBEARAN"

  Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
  Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  And that which should accompany old age,
  Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.
  Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And my imaginations are as foul
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.


MCCCXCV - "DCHIDETRYBEAUT"

  Discredit my authority with yours;
  Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
  He hath not money for these Irish wars,
  I will not be afraid of death and bane,
  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
  But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  Us friends; I will pursue the amity.
  To bear the tidings of calamity.


MCCCXCVI - "YANDTHYSTRAYIN"

  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
  You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
  I have inform'd his highness so at large
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.


MCCCXCVII - "GYOUTHWHOLEADT"

  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
  Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
  His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
  O momentary grace of mortal men,
  Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.


MCCCXCVIII - "HEEINTHEIRRIOT"

  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  That due of many now is thine alone:
  His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Into a thousand parts divide on man,
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  In spite of pope or dignities of church,
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  To see thy noble uncle thus distract?


MCCCXCIX - "EVENTHEREWHERE"

  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
  Hath he excepted most against my love.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MCD - "THOUARTFORCEDT"

  That virtue must go through. We must not stint
  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  Are brought to the correction of your law.
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
  Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
  Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Did to his predecessors part withal.
  That light we see is burning in my hall.


MCDI - "OBREAKATWOFOLD"

  O good old man, how well in thee appears
  Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
  Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
  And they have served me to effectless use:
  To think their dolour others have endured.
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
  For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
  O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.


MCDII - "TRUTHHERSBYTHY"

  That mought not be distinguished; but at last
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
  Have hent the gates, and very near upon
  His foes are so enrooted with his friends
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
  Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
  Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.


MCDIII - "BEAUTYTEMPTING"

  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
  The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
  That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
  I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.


MCDIV - "HERTOTHEETHINE"

  How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  To make this shameless callet know herself.
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
  How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  Her brother is in secret come from France;
  In any case, be not too rough in terms;
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MCDV - "BYTHYBEAUTYBEI"

  Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
  Your master wed me to: nothing but death
  That such immanity and bloody strife
  How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  Being once perfected how to grant suits,
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  That carries no impression like the dam.
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  I would the fool were married to her grave!


MCDVI - "NGFALSETOMETHA"

  Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
  Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
  For what they have not, that which they possess
  And what does else want credit, come to me,
  Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
  O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
  And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.


MCDVII - "TTHOUHASTHERIT"

  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  How will my mother for a father's death
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
  The proffer'd means of succor and redress.


MCDVIII - "ISNOTALLMYGRIE"

  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Sole monarch of the universal earth.
  Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
  The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,
  According to your ladyship's impose,
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MCDIX - "FANDYETITMAYBE"

  For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
  And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
  Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  You must not take for fire. From this time
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  Then belike my children shall have no names:
  My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
  A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
  You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
  By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MCDX - "SAIDILOVEDHERD"

  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  In confutation of which rude reproach
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
  O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  He hath some message to deliver us.
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?


MCDXI - "EARLYTHATSHEHA"

  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
  Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
  The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
  His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
  Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
  The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  Her father is no better than an earl,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  A lute-string and now governed by stops.


MCDXII - "THTHEEISOFMYWA"

  Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  This husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
  He is no less than what we say he is.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  I will not have excuse, with saying this
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
  From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
  Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
  And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.


MCDXIII - "ILINGCHIEFALOS"

  If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
  Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
  His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
  I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.
  As those that I am come to tell you of!
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is
  Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.


MCDXIV - "SINLOVETHATTOU"

  Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
  In this same interlude it doth befall
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Let his deservings and my love withal
  Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
  Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,
  Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.


MCDXV - "CHESMEMORENEAR"

  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Myself, as far as I could well discern
  Or else for ever be confixed here,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.


MCDXVI - "LYLOVINGOFFEND"

  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  I am so angry at these abject terms;
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
  Fare you well; go.    Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE
  For none offend where all alike do dote.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.


MCDXVII - "ERSTHUSIWILLEX"

  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
  That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
  Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
  Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
  I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
 eXpress impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MCDXVIII - "CUSEYETHOUDOST"

  Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  That she will light to listen to the lays,
  He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
  Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
  That hath in it no profit but the name.


MCDXIX - "LOVEHERBECAUSE"

  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  On yon proud man, should take it off again
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
  But smacks of something greater than herself,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MCDXX - "THOUKNOWSTILOV"

  Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
  Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
  Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
  If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
  Looking the way her harmless young one went,
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MCDXXI - "EHERANDFORMYSA"

  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  He lends out money gratis and brings down
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  And for mine too: when law can do no right,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
  O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
  Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
  And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.


MCDXXII - "KEEVENSODOTHSH"

  Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
  His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
  So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
  How came you in these parts? where were you bred?


MCDXXIII - "EABUSEMESUFFER"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
  Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
  Upon your oath of service to the pope,
  Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  For me, I force not argument a straw,
  For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MCDXXIV - "INGMYFRIENDFOR"

  I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  Give even way unto my rough affairs;
  My parts, my title and my perfect soul
  Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
  For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  For lovers ever run before the clock.
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.


MCDXXV - "MYSAKETOAPPROV"

  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
  Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
  Against my life: the minute of their plot
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Of my word, I have written to effect;
  Very hardly upon such a subject.


MCDXXVI - "EHERIFILOSETHE"

  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  He will allow no speech, which I do guess
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
  From him that fled some strange indignity,
  Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
  Love can transpose to form and dignity:
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.


MCDXXVII - "EMYLOSSISMYLOV"

  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Master, your love must live a maid at home;
  You will bestow her on Orlando here?
  Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
  O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
  Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
  In that each of you have forsworn his book,
  Sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MCDXXVIII - "ESGAINANDLOSIN"

  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
  Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
  Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Spur post, and get before him to the king,
  I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.


MCDXXIX - "GHERMYFRIENDHA"

  Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
  Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Making not reservation of yourselves,
  You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
  For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  I know I am too mean to be your queen,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  How long have you been of this profession?
  And stalk in blood to our possession?


MCDXXX - "THFOUNDTHATLOS"

  To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
  Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
  Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  Holds from all soldiers chief majority
  And so once more return and tell his grace.
  To him and his usurp'd authority.
  Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Signior, hang! base muleters of France!


MCDXXXI - "SBOTHFINDEACHO"

  See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
  Beggar the estimation which you prized
  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
  There let them bide until we have devised
  He lives that loves thee better than he could.
  For that they will not intercept my tale:
  I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  All length is torture: since the torch is out,
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?


MCDXXXII - "THERANDILOSEBO"

  To use one language in each several clime
  Hearing applause and universal shout,
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
  Live here in heaven and may look on her;
  Of mediation, after I am dead,
  Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  Of such misery doth she cut me off.


MCDXXXIII - "THTWAINANDBOTH"

  To none of these, except it be the last;
  Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
  Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
  I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
  But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
  Or on Diana's altar to protest
  To be oppos'd against the warring winds?
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.


MCDXXXIV - "FORMYSAKELAYON"

  Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;
  Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  You make strong party, or defend yourself
  See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
  And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
  Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.


MCDXXXV - "METHISCROSSBUT"

  My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  That we the horrider may seem to those
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  Send danger from the east unto the west,
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
  Then think you right: I am not what I am.


MCDXXXVI - "HERESTHEJOYMYF"

  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  She is a theme of honour and renown,
  To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
  Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
  My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
  Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
  Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.


MCDXXXVII - "RIENDANDIAREON"

  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  If in which time expired, he not return,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  And fertile every wish, a million.
  Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  Desire them an to my pavilion.
  I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.


MCDXXXVIII - "ESWEETFLATTERY"

  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Till I return, of posting is no need.
  For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
  Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
  And when you find him evenly derived
  The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
  The tidings come that they are all arrived.
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Retain but privilege of a private man?
  Yet this I will not do, do how I can.


MCDXXXIX - "THENSHELOVESBU"

  To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
  But I have that within which passeth show-
  Upon my blessing, I command thee go.


MCDXL - "TMEALONEWHENMO"

  Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
  Make it a darling like your precious eye;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
  Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
  O, think my son to be as dear to me!
  Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
  England, bound in with the triumphant sea
  Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Nor ask advice of any other thought
  Much like a press of people at a door,
  Out of my sight, and never see me more!


MCDXLI - "STIWINKTHENDOM"

  Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
  Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  War-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
  That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
  He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
  Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
  Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.


MCDXLII - "INEEYESBESTSEE"

  In no less working than are swords and bows
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MCDXLIII - "FORALLTHEDAYTH"

  For my profession's sacred from above:
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
  As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Those that would die or ere resist are grown
  How many years a mortal man may live.
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
  As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
  You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
  To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
  He is not with himself; let us withdraw.


MCDXLIV - "EYVIEWTHINGSUN"

  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  If tears could help, mine own would do me good.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Who will believe my verse in time to come,
  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
  If they were known, as the suspect is great,
  None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
  Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Not better than he, by her own report.


MCDXLV - "RESPECTEDBUTWH"

  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
  Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
  By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
  Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
  To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
  What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
  How does my old acquaintance of this isle?


MCDXLVI - "ENISLEEPINDREA"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  No, holy father; throw away that thought;
  If case some one of you would fly from us,
  Should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
  Let it be who it is: for Romans now
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  A choking gall and a preserving sweet.


MCDXLVII - "MSTHEYLOOKONTH"

  Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
  Shall send between the red rose and the white
  To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
  Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  O, but I love his lady too too much,
  King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
  Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!


MCDXLVIII - "EEANDDARKLYBRI"

  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  And ever let his unrecalling crime
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  And majesty might never yet endure
  Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  Like very sanctity, she did approach
  You are deceived; my child is none of his:
  But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?


MCDXLIX - "GHTAREBRIGHTIN"

  Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  That sees into the bottom of my grief?
  And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
  I should fight withal, if he be alive.
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.


MCDL - "DARKDIRECTEDTH"

  Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
  A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
  Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
  I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
  The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  The king and his companions: warily
  Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?


MCDLI - "ENTHOUWHOSESHA"

  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  With such a kind of love as might become
  His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
  Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Hast the harvest out of thine own report.
  As this their jangling I esteem a sport.


MCDLII - "DOWSHADOWSDOTH"

  Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
  Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
  Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
  Set your entreatments at a higher rate
  His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
  Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
  Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
  The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
  Her best is better'd with a more delight.


MCDLIII - "MAKEBRIGHTHOWW"

  Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
  And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Being once perfected how to grant suits,
  Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
  I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
  Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
  He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
  Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
  Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
  O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
  Which had you rather, that the most just law
  What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?


MCDLIV - "OULDTHYSHADOWS"

  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  That one for all, or all for one we gage;
  He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
  Your children's children quit it in your age.
  Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
  He has discover'd my design, and I
  And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
  Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
  O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
  Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?


MCDLV - "FORMFORMHAPPYS"

  From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Make thee the father of their idle dreams
  Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  A thing divine, for nothing natural
  Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
  Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.


MCDLVI - "HOWTOTHECLEARD"

  Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
  To stay him from the fall of vanity:
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
  How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
  Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.


MCDLVII - "AYWITHTHYMUCHC"

  A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
  You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
  Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
  I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
  To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  That had not half a week to go, like rams
  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
  Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
  My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
  Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
  Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.


MCDLVIII - "LEARERLIGHTWHE"

  Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
  I do embrace your offer; and dispose
  Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
  Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
  To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.
  Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MCDLIX - "NTOUNSEEINGEYE"

  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Not he which says the dead is not alive.
  So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Is near the hate of those love not the king.
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


MCDLX - "STHYSHADESHINE"

  Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
  Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
  Intends his journey; and within three days
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MCDLXI - "SSOHOWWOULDISA"

  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
  Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
  Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
  Will not debate the question of this straw.
  O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
  Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
  And Talbot perisheth by your default.


MCDLXII - "YMINEEYESBEBLE"

  You may deny that you were not the cause
  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  Into the service of the time and was
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  She is a woman, therefore may be won;
  But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  But as I travell'd hither through the land,
  Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MCDLXIII - "SSEDMADEBYLOOK"

  Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
  Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  More than a wild exposture to each chance
  Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.


MCDLXIV - "INGONTHEEINTHE"

  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
  Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
  Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
  Now one the better, then another best;
  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  I'll keep you company. Will you along?
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
  He came too late, the ship was under sail:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MCDLXV - "LIVINGDAYWHENI"

  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  As my great patron thought on in my prayers-
  You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
  With half their forces the full Pride of France
  Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
  If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.


MCDLXVI - "NDEADNIGHTTHYF"

  No, I will weep no more. In such a night
  Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
  Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
  His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
  That does infect the land: with which they moved
  To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  First, heaven be the record to my speech!


MCDLXVII - "AIRIMPERFECTSH"

  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  In that it scorns to bear another hue;
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
  Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  Continued so, until we thought he died.
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.


MCDLXVIII - "ADETHROUGHHEAV"

  As likely to be blest in peace and war;
  Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
  He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Under whose government come they along?
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
  Hover about me with your airy wings
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.


MCDLXIX - "YSLEEPONSIGHTL"

  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
  O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
  In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
  Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.


MCDLXX - "ESSEYESDOTHSTA"

  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  You do impeach your modesty too much,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such
  Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
  That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
  This sudden sending him away must seem
  A senseless help when help past sense we deem.


MCDLXXI - "YALLDAYSARENIG"

  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  As pledges of my fealty and love;
  Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
  Love make your fortunes twenty times above
  Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
  And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  And, if you may confess it, say withal,
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  Give so much light that I may read by them.


MCDLXXII - "HTSTOSEETILLIS"

  His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
  That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
  Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
  They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
  O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
  In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
  Incite them to quick motion; for I must
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.


MCDLXXIII - "EETHEEANDNIGHT"

  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
  Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
  To enforce the pained impotent to smile.


MCDLXXIV - "SBRIGHTDAYSWHE"

  Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
  But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
  Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
  How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
  You may as well do anything most hard,
  Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:
  Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


MCDLXXV - "NDREAMSDOSHOWT"

  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  And then end life when I end loyalty!
  My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:
  Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
  Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
  Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
  That I no more can see what once I was!


MCDLXXVI - "HEEMEIFTHEDULL"

  He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  I was preserved to serve this noble count.
  For such proceeding I am charged withal,
  That only to stand high in your account,
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.


MCDLXXVII - "SUBSTANCEOFMYF"

  So I by that; it is my day, my life.
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.
  She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
  There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
  And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
  Now sit we close about this taper here,
  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
  First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
  Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
  Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
  For I have bought it with an hundred blows.


MCDLXXVIII - "LESHWERETHOUGH"

  Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
  Her more than haste is mated with delays,
  Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.


MCDLXXIX - "TINJURIOUSDIST"

  To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
  Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
  Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.
  The lazy time, if not with some delight?


MCDLXXX - "ANCESHOULDNOTS"

  As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
  Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
  Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  So sweet a death as hanging presently.


MCDLXXXI - "TOPMYWAYFORTHE"

  That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
  My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
  Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
  With many hundreds treading on his heels;
  And says that once more I shall interchange
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.


MCDLXXXII - "NDESPITEOFSPAC"

  Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
  For more is to be said and to be done
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
  And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
  Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.


MCDLXXXIII - "EIWOULDBEBROUG"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  We should take root here where we sit, or sit
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  But the defendant doth that plea deny
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
  Unless a brother should a brother dare
  Give me some sack; and, sweetheart, lie thou there.


MCDLXXXIV - "HTFROMLIMITSFA"

  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  There is a history in all men's lives,
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  My custom always of the afternoon,
  Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
  It is the very error of the moon;
  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  Fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
  And may you prove, sir, master of your art!


MCDLXXXV - "RREMOTEWHERETH"

  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Reserve their character with golden quill
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  More than enough am I that vex thee still,
  Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
  There will I make thee a bed of roses,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  Hear from me still, and never of me aught
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.
  He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.


MCDLXXXVI - "OUDOSTSTAYNOMA"

  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  On whom I may confer what I have got:
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  That I should questionless be fortunate!
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  And when you would say something that is sad,
  Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
  Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
  O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.


MCDLXXXVII - "TTERTHENALTHOU"

  Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
  The cruel issue of these bloody men;
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  This was an ill beginning of the night:
  He that has and a little tiny wit-
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
  The king with mighty and quick-raised power
  Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
  Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
  Upon so soft a subject as myself!


MCDLXXXVIII - "GHMYFOOTDIDSTA"

  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  Holds from all soldiers chief majority
  Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
  Your sovereign greatness and authority.
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
  Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  Something to do with you. Come, you're a young
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.


MCDLXXXIX - "NDUPONTHEFARTH"

  No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
  Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  How she opposes her against my will
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  For which the heavens, taking angry note,
  And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.


MCDXC - "ESTEARTHREMOVE"

  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
  Then take him up, and manage well the jest:
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  Have they been merry! which their keepers call
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MCDXCI - "DFROMTHEEFORNI"

  Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!
  Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  O God, that right should thus overcome might!
  More than a little is by much too much.
  The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
  Honour and virtue and conversed with such
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  I will be mild and gentle in my speech.


MCDXCII - "MBLETHOUGHTCAN"

  My love admits no qualifying dross;
  Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
  Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Takes on the point of honour to support
  Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
  O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
  As great in admiration as herself;
  Never lacks power to dismiss itself.


MCDXCIII - "JUMPBOTHSEAAND"

  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
  My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
  Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
  One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
  That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
  His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
  Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  And on your finger in the night I'll put
  And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
  No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.


MCDXCIV - "LANDASSOONASTH"

  Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
  And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  She prizes not such trifles as these are:
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  O, that your young nobility could judge
  Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
  That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.


MCDXCV - "INKTHEPLACEWHE"

  In confutation of which rude reproach
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  King John, your king and England's doth approach,
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  He shall here find his friends with horse and men
  Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
  Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  What, will you walk with me about the town,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.


MCDXCVI - "REHEWOULDBEBUT"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
  Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  Business, my lord! I think most understand
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
  The King and Queen and all are coming down.


MCDXCVII - "AHTHOUGHTKILLS"

  As level as the cannon to his blank,
  He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
  Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
  Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
  Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
  Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.


MCDXCVIII - "METHATIAMNOTTH"

  My father's purposes have been mistook;
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Think, being too strong for him, though he took
  He might return to vasty Tartar back,
  Absent thee from felicity awhile,
  Together with that fair and warlike form
  I jest to Oberon and make him smile
  And with a great heart heave away the storm:
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
  To drive away the heavy thought of care?
  How easy is a bush supposed a bear!


MCDXCIX - "OUGHTTOLEAPLAR"

  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
  Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.


MD - "GELENGTHSOFMIL"

  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  No; I will sit and watch here by the King.
  Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
  Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
  Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
  So then two bosoms and a single troth.
  O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
  For to deny each article with oath
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  I know from whence this same device proceeds:
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.


MDI - "ESWHENTHOUARTG"

  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
  Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.


MDII - "ONEBUTTHATSOMU"

  O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,
  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
  And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
  The better arm you to the sudden time,
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


MDIII - "CHOFEARTHANDWA"

  Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
  He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
  O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
  For man or master. Then it follows thus:
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
  With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
  And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.


MDIV - "TERWROUGHTIMUS"

  Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  May be put from her by society:
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
  She should have bought her dignities so dear.


MDV - "TATTENDTIMESLE"

  Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
  And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
  The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;
  Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  No further halting: satisfy me home
  Disdaining me and throwing favours on
  To take in many towns ere almost Rome
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  Making not reservation of yourselves,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


MDVI - "ISUREWITHMYMOA"

  I was directed hither: men report
  Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
  In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
  Mine appetite I never more will grind
  Your heart is full of something that does take
  My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.


MDVII - "NRECEIVINGNOUG"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Reward did threaten and encourage him,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  It will the woefullest division prove
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
  No more infected with my country's love
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.


MDVIII - "HTBYELEMENTSSO"

  Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
  Together with that fair and warlike form
  Being the bosom lover of my lord,
  Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
  The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
  Subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
  Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
  O heavy times, begetting such events!


MDIX - "SLOWBUTHEAVYTE"

  Stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  What is amiss plague and infection mend!
  But when contention and occasion meet,
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
  Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
  Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MDX - "ARSBADGESOFEIT"

  Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
  Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
  Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
  Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  I do beweep to many simple gulls
  The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.


MDXI - "HERSWOETHEOTHE"

  How shall this bisson multitude digest
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
  Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MDXII - "RTWOSLIGHTAIRA"

  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
  Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
  This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
  As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
  I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?


MDXIII - "NDPURGINGFIREA"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  I do assure thee, father, so it is.
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  For never was a story of more woe
  Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.


MDXIV - "REBOTHWITHTHEE"

  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Because I love you, I will let you know:
  One way or other, she is for a king;
  Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  When I should bid good-morrow to my bride
  I would to God that the inclusive verge
  Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
  Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
  The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MDXV - "WHEREVERIABIDE"

  What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Into your idle over-handled theme:
  And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
  Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
  If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MDXVI - "THEFIRSTMYTHOU"

  The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
  How often he had met you, sword to sword;
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
  I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  To reason most absurd, whose common theme
  My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
  Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
  Of any true decision. Nature craves
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.


MDXVII - "GHTTHEOTHERMYD"

  Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
  He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
  That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
  That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
  Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
  Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.


MDXVIII - "ESIRETHESEPRES"

  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  So two, together weeping, make one woe.


MDXIX - "ENTABSENTWITHS"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
  To Italy; and there at Venice gave
  And mark what object did present itself.
  But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
  That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.
  Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,
  I was too strict to make mine own away;
  Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.


MDXX - "WIFTMOTIONSLID"

  Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Finding myself in honour so forbid,
  Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
  My boon I make it that you know me not
  O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
  To keep by policy what Henry got?
  I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
  Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
  I pray you stand good father to me now;
  Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!


MDXXI - "EFORWHENTHESEQ"

  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!
  Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.


MDXXII - "UICKERELEMENTS"

  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  May all the building in my fancy pluck
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  To clear this spot by death, at least I give
  Should dying men flatter with those that live?


MDXXIII - "AREGONEINTENDE"

  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
  Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
  That having such a scope to show her pride,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MDXXIV - "REMBASSYOFLOVE"

  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  My father's purposes have been mistook;
  But your request shall make me let it pass.
  As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
  Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
  Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.


MDXXV - "TOTHEEMYLIFEBE"

  This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
  Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
  Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
  From which awaked, the truth of what we are
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  But not the form of what he should attend.
  Either of you to be the other's end.


MDXXVI - "INGMADEOFFOURW"

  I crave fit disposition for my wife.
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
  And yet I know not how to get the crown,
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
  For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
  For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?


MDXXVII - "ITHTWOALONESIN"

  Inclinable to honour and advance
  The bloody proclamation to escape
  Her brother is in secret come from France;
  The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
  Would I might never stir from off this place,
  O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
  And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
  Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell:
  It is my will, the which if thou respect,
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.


MDXXVIII - "KSDOWNTODEATHO"

  Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
  Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;
  That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
  On purpose shut the doors against his way.
  Did ever love so dearly: let her live
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  And that his beauty may the better thrive,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.


MDXXIX - "PPRESSDWITHMEL"

  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
  Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
  If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
  The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
  Having received the punishment before,
  My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.


MDXXX - "ANCHOLYUNTILLI"

  A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
  Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
  He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
  Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
  Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
  Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
  The better act of purposes mistook
  I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.


MDXXXI - "FESCOMPOSITION"

  From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
  If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
  The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
  If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
  On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.


MDXXXII - "BERECUREDBYTHO"

  Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
  Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
  Here sits a king more woful than you are.
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!


MDXXXIII - "SESWIFTMESSENG"

  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Suppose they take offence without a cause,
  Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
  In forwarding this dear expedience.
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  Thy humble servant vows obedience
  My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.


MDXXXIV - "ERSRETURNDFROM"

  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  To bring him to the haven; left these notes
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Make choice of which your highness will see first.


MDXXXV - "THEEWHOEVENBUT"

  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  He makes me angry with him; for he seems
  Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
  But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  These words like daggers enter in mine ears.


MDXXXVI - "NOWCOMEBACKAGA"

  Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
  With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
  And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
  Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
  Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
  And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
  Give me the letter; I will look on it.
  And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!


MDXXXVII - "INASSUREDOFTHY"

  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
  Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
  Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
  The labour of each knight in his device.
  Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
  You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!


MDXXXVIII - "FAIRHEALTHRECO"

  For, look you, I may make the belly smile
  And--God consigning to my good intents-
  I am not merry; but I do beguile
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
  That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,
  His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!


MDXXXIX - "UNTINGITTOMETH"

  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
  I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  Is as a fury to torment my soul;
  There is a gentleman that serves the count
  The fishermen that walk upon the beach
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Montano and myself being in speech,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?


MDXL - "ISTOLDIJOYBUTT"

  Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
  Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
  John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
  Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
  That I have been thus pleasant with you both.


MDXLI - "HENNOLONGERGLA"

  Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.


MDXLII - "DISENDTHEMBACK"

  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
  I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
  This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  And like a mountain, not to be removed.
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MDXLIII - "AGAINANDSTRAIG"

  Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
  God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  I say I love thee more than he can do.
  Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
  And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
  Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
  There, where your argosies with portly sail,
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
  I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
  Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.


MDXLIV - "HTGROWSADMINEE"

  His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
  Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
  Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Of any king's in Europe. I do think
  Weeping before for what she saw must come,
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
  Drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
  My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
  In seeking to augment it, but still keep
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MDXLV - "YEANDHEARTAREA"

  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  An if the devil come and roar for them,
  Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Then go with me to make the matter good.
  And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  And either victory, or else a grave.


MDXLVI - "TAMORTALWARHOW"

  The night to the owl and morn to the lark
  And like a mountain, not to be removed.
  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
  The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
  Where I will write. All may be well enough.
  And stalk in blood to our possession?
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  How long have you been of this profession?
  O, step between her and her fighting soul
  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.


MDXLVII - "TODIVIDETHECON"

  That makes him honour'd, or begets him hate;
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  If I think so, I think the same of you.
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
  Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
  No, no, men living flatter those that die.


MDXLVIII - "QUESTOFTHYSIGH"

  Question, my lords, no further of the case,
  Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
  This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
  They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  Your exposition on the holy text
  Study to break it and not break my troth.
  I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  How does my old acquaintance of this isle?


MDXLIX - "TMINEEYEMYHEAR"

  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  My father and my grandfather were kings,
  Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
  Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
  Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MDL - "TTHYPICTURESSI"

  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Try many, all good, serve truly, never
  Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
  You're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
  Call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
  Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
  It was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.


MDLI - "GHTWOULDBARMYH"

  Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
  Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
  The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
  With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
  Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  By how much of me their reproach contains.
  And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.


MDLII - "EARTMINEEYETHE"

  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Appointed to direct these fair designs.
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
  Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
  I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  You use in abject and in slavish parts,
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
  His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MDLIII - "FREEDOMOFTHATR"

  For eighteen months concluded by consent.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
  That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
  As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
  Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.


MDLIV - "IGHTMYHEARTDOT"

  In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
  Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  And my estate deserves an heir more raised
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  To half a soul and to a notion crazed
  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  One time or other break some gallows' back.
  To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.


MDLV - "HPLEADTHATTHOU"

  Have broken with the king; who hath so far
  Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
  Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
  How that ambitious Constance would not cease
  And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
  The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
  The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.


MDLVI - "INHIMDOSTLIEAC"

  It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
  Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  My speech and what is done, tell him he has
  Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
  There was not such a gracious creature born.
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
  Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!


MDLVII - "LOSETNEVERPIER"

  Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;
  Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
  So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MDLVIII - "CEDWITHCRYSTAL"

  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
  I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
  Thou art too noble to conserve a life
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
  Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
  The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
  A whole armado of convicted sail
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.


MDLIX - "EYESBUTTHEDEFE"

  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Beggar the estimation which you prized
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  The constancy and virtue of your love.
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MDLX - "NDANTDOTHTHATP"

  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
  Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
  His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
  These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
  How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
  As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
  This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
  Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.


MDLXI - "LEADENYANDSAYS"

  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Appears before them and with solemn march
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
  Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
  Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
  Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  And both the princes had been breathing here,
  You know I am a woman, lacking wit
  So many guests invite as here are writ.


MDLXII - "INHIMTHYFAIRAP"

  I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
  Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
  You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  France is revolted from the English quite,
  And justly and religiously unfold
  If you deny it, let the danger light
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
  Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?


MDLXIII - "PEARANCELIESTO"

  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  And like rich hangings in a homely house,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Come, come, you forward and unable worms!
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Let loose on me the justice of the state
  I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
  The boy gives warning something doth approach.
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?


MDLXIV - "CIDETHISTITLEI"

  Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,
  I shall receive the money for the same.
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Threw my affections in his charmed power,
  Her parentage; being demanded that,
  If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  I was not much afeard; for once or twice
  The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!


MDLXV - "SIMPANNELEDAQU"

  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Perforce will force it overflow the bank.
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
  And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
  Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
  Using no other weapon but his name.


MDLXVI - "ESTOFTHOUGHTSA"

  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  She that in wisdom never was so frail
  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
  Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
  For yet ere supper-time must I perform
  To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
  Had not been here to dress the ugly form
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!


MDLXVII - "LLTENANTSTOTHE"

  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
  Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  The enemy more mighty than he seems:
  Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
  To die is to be banish'd from myself;
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  The bearer knows not, but commends itself
  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MDLXVIII - "HEARTANDBYTHEI"

  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.
  And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  I'll die on him that says so but yourself.


MDLXIX - "RVERDICTISDETE"

  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Do I put up that womanly defence,
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
  It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
  Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
  Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That no supporter but the huge firm earth
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MDLXX - "RMINEDTHECLEAR"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
  If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And writers say, as the most forward bud
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?


MDLXXI - "EYESMOIETYANDT"

  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  That rage in savage sensuality.
  You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
  And death's dim look in life's mortality:
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  The labour of each knight in his device.


MDLXXII - "HEDEARHEARTSPA"

  Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  And in a dark and dankish vault at home
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  The strongest body shall it make most weak,
  Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
  Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
  A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?


MDLXXIII - "RTASTHUSMINEEY"

  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  To cavil in the course of this contract:
  Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
  Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.
  My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  You do advance your cunning more and more.


MDLXXIV - "ESDUEISTHYOUTW"

  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
  She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
  Than will preserve just so much strength in us
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
  With any long'd-for change or better state.


MDLXXV - "ARDPARTANDMYHE"

  Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
  Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
  And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
  A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  Might be affronted with the match and weight
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  How and which way I may bestow myself
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MDLXXVI - "ARTSRIGHTTHYIN"

  A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
  Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  How often said, my dignity would last
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  That holds this present question in the court?
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  Yet once again, to make us public sport,
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.


MDLXXVII - "WARDLOVEOFHEAR"

  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Do to this body what extremes you can;
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MDLXXVIII - "TBETWIXTMINEEY"

  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  This token serveth for a flag of truce
  When I behold the violet past prime,
  I would not my unhoused free condition
 eXception bid him speak, and at this time
  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.


MDLXXIX - "EANDHEARTALEAG"

  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  How well resembles it the prime of youth,
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  All my reports go with the modest truth;
  Regard thy danger, and along with me!
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
  Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.


MDLXXX - "UEISTOOKANDEAC"

  Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
  Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
  The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  O, this will make my mother die with grief!
  Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
  And to their hope they such odd action yield,
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  Did he so often lodge in open field,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
  Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.


MDLXXXI - "HDOTHGOODTURNS"

  His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
  Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
  Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
  To cloak offences with a cunning brow.
  Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
  Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  This man hath my consent to marry her.
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
  So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.


MDLXXXII - "NOWUNTOTHEOTHE"

  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.
  Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
  Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
  That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
  How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  Them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MDLXXXIII - "RWHENTHATMINEE"

  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  When everything is ended, then you come.
  Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Neglect the visitation of my friends.
  Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
  To be commenced in strands afar remote.
  My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MDLXXXIV - "YEISFAMISHDFOR"

  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
  So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
  Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
  An onion will do well for such a shift,
  My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
  I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
  So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.


MDLXXXV - "ALOOKORHEARTIN"

  Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
  Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
  Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
  Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Are now become enamour'd on his grave.
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  The hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.


MDLXXXVI - "LOVEWITHSIGHSH"

  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
  I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
  Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
  Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  She is a woman, therefore to be won.
  He is my prize; I will not look upon.


MDLXXXVII - "IMSELFDOTHSMOT"

  I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
  My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
  So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  That, otherwise than noble nature did,
  He that shall live this day, and see old age,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
  Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
  Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!


MDLXXXVIII - "HERWITHMYLOVES"

  Hear from me still, and never of me aught
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  When they change us for others? Is it sport?
  I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
  Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  You are transported by calamity
  Let each man render me his bloody hand:
  Of our restored love and amity.
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.


MDLXXXIX - "PICTURETHENMYE"

  Patience is scottish, and impatience does
  I have been closely shrouded in this bush
  Cool and congeal again to what it was.
  To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
  Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Nature should be so conversant with pain,
  My message must return from whence it came.
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MDXC - "YEDOTHFEASTAND"

  You may behold confusion of your foes.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Deny your asking: take your choice of those
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
  For nothing but his majesty's approach.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
  That he could nothing do but wish and beg
  And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
  Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
  Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.


MDXCI - "TOTHEPAINTEDBA"

  They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
  Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
  The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
  Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
  I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
  No more pains for those thanks than you took pains
  That day that made my sister thirteen years.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!


MDXCII - "NQUETBIDSMYHEA"

  No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
  Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
  I know they are stuff'd with protestations
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
  Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
  You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And Somerset another goodly mast?


MDXCIII - "RTANOTHERTIMEM"

  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
  A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.
  My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.


MDXCIV - "INEEYEISMYHEAR"

  I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  I see things too, although you judge I wink.
  Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
  May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.


MDXCV - "TSGUESTANDINHI"

  To show itself but pride, for supple knees
  Shotten herring. There live not three good men
  Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.
  As they fly by them with their woven wings.
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Dispersed are the glories it included.
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
  He has borne all things well: and I do think
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.


MDXCVI - "STHOUGHTSOFLOV"

  Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
  That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
  Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
  Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Firm and irrevocable is my doom
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Observe degree, priority and place,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MDXCVII - "EDOTHSHAREAPAR"

  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
  There was not such a gracious creature born.
  Her father and her country and her friends,
  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
  Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MDXCVIII - "TSOEITHERBYTHY"

  Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
  The present money to discharge the Jew,
  Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
  Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
  Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.


MDXCIX - "PICTUREORMYLOV"

  Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
  I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
  Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
  To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  Last, and as much containing as all these,
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MDC - "ETHYSELFAWAYAR"

  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  To hear the replication of your sounds
  How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
  You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  For this affliction has a taste as sweet
  Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
  And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
  You were conducted to a gentle bath
  An onion will do well for such a shift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


MDCI - "TRESENTSTILLWI"

  Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  The old bees die, the young possess their hive:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
  I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
  Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
  Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
  Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!


MDCII - "THMEFORTHOUNOT"

  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  My advocation is not now in tune;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  No bargains break that are not this day made:
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  That men must lay their murders on your neck.


MDCIII - "FARTHERTHANMYT"

  Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
  As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.
  Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  That brought her for this high good turn so far?
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  As touching France, to give a greater sum
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.


MDCIV - "HOUGHTSCANSTMO"

  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
  Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
  The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
  A canopy most fatal, under which
  Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
  Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
  O, how her fear did make her colour rise!


MDCV - "VEANDIAMSTILLW"

  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
  Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  And then the king will court thee for his dear;
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  I have inform'd his highness so at large
  Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
  Love? his affections do not that way tend;
  Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.


MDCVI - "ITHTHEMANDTHEY"

  It provokes the desire, but it takes
  Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  Hath set the women on to this complaint:
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  My sable ground of sin I will not paint,
  A young and learned doctor to our court.
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.


MDCVII - "WITHTHEEORIFTH"

  When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
  For how can tyrants safely govern home,
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.


MDCVIII - "EYSLEEPTHYPICT"

  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Your honours shall perceive how I will work
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.


MDCIX - "UREINMYSIGHTAW"

  Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
  Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  You follow the young Prince up and down, like
  Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
  Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
  Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,
  Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
  That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
  Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
  Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.


MDCX - "AKESMYHEARTTOH"

  All the commerce that you have had with Troy
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  See how the blood is settled in his face.
  Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  And such high vaunts of his nobility,
  Reward did threaten and encourage him,
  That, from the sense of all civility,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
  Here comes the almanac of my true date.


MDCXI - "EARTSANDEYESDE"

  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  The action of their bodies from their souls;
  Say that before Ascension-day at noon
  And all combined, save what thou must combine
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  Soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
  During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MDCXII - "LIGHTHOWCAREFU"

  Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
  I long to know the truth hereof at large.
  Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
  Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
  To furnish me with some swift means of death
  Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  We should profane the service of the dead
  Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
  And that to the infection of my brains
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!


MDCXIII - "LWASIWHENITOOK"

  Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
  What is the issue of the business there.
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Without much shame retold or spoken of.
  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
  I did not bid you mar it to the time.
  They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MDCXIV - "MYWAYEACHTRIFL"

  My love admits no qualifying dross;
  You are deceived, my substance is not here;
  Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
  A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
  Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  And by my friends, I am abused: so that,
  Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
  Having his ear full of his airy fame,
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
  Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.


MDCXV - "EUNDERTRUESTBA"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  The baby figure of the giant mass
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  That swift as quicksilver it courses through
  But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
  And for his safety there I'll best devise.


MDCXVI - "RSTOTHRUSTTHAT"

  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
  To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  And know us by these colours for thy foes,
  This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.


MDCXVII - "TOMYUSEITMIGHT"

  The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.
  Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
  Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  Sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  If you do hold the same intent wherein
  That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  The happy tidings of his good escape.


MDCXVIII - "UNUSEDSTAYFROM"

  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
  The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
  Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.


MDCXIX - "HANDSOFFALSEHO"

  How often said, my dignity would last
  And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
  For more uneven and unwelcome news
  Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Hath to the marbled mansion all above
  Out of her favour, where I am in love.


MDCXX - "ODINSUREWARDSO"

  Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
  Depart again: here, here will I remain
  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
  Now fear I this will give it start again;
  Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Disguise us at my lodging and return,
  Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!


MDCXXI - "FTRUSTBUTTHOUT"

  For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
  Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
  Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
  Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.
  The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  O, let me pray before I take my death!
  Us friends; I will pursue the amity.
  To bear the tidings of calamity.


MDCXXII - "OWHOMMYJEWELST"

  Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
  Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
  Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Making them proud of his humility,
  My body shall make good upon this earth,
  Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
  Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Which is infallible, to England's crown.
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
  Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
  That calls me traitor, I return the lie.


MDCXXIII - "RIFLESAREMOSTW"

  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  For nothing had begot my something grief;
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
  Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
  There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
  Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?


MDCXXIV - "ORTHYOFCOMFORT"

  O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
  Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
  The elements be kind to thee, and make
  Have studied physic, through which secret art,
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  For ever should they be expulsed from France
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
  Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
  O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.


MDCXXV - "NOWMYGREATESTG"

  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
  Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.
  You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
  Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
  There is no world without Verona walls,
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
  God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!


MDCXXVI - "RIEFTHOUBESTOF"

  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  From this my hand, as holding of the pope
  To whom you are but as a form in wax
  Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  But then renew I could not, like the moon;
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
  That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!


MDCXXVII - "DEARESTANDMINE"

  Desire them an to my pavilion.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  And fertile every wish, a million.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
  Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:
  And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  I would not my unhoused free condition
  Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MDCXXVIII - "ONLYCAREARTLEF"

  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
  And she is mine, and all my right of her
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  For I have bought it with an hundred blows.


MDCXXIX - "TTHEPREYOFEVER"

  This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  How say you now? is not your husband mad?
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MDCXXX - "YVULGARTHIEFTH"

  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Give me superfluous death.  A noise within.
  Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
  I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  How many years a mortal man may live.


MDCXXXI - "EEHAVEINOTLOCK"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
  Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Or any air of music touch their ears,
  Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.


MDCXXXII - "DUPINANYCHESTS"

  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
  In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
  Now do I long to hear how you were found;
  As, not to see a woman in that term,
  No man so potent breathes upon the ground
  Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
  Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
  How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.


MDCXXXIII - "AVEWHERETHOUAR"

  Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
  Here is my hand; the premises observed,
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  And yet the king not privy to my drift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


MDCXXXIV - "TNOTTHOUGHIFEE"

  The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
  Not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
  O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
  That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
  His spell in that is out: the king hath found
  I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
  Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MDCXXXV - "LTHOUARTWITHIN"

  Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
  The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
  Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
  On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
  Upon the heavy middle of the night
  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  To join like likes and kiss like native things.
  Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
  Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
  That I should seem to lack humanity
  He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
  Naming thy name blesses an ill report.


MDCXXXVI - "THEGENTLECLOSU"

  They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
  He will be here, and yet he is not here:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  Let me be no assistant for a state,
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?


MDCXXXVII - "REOFMYBREASTFR"

  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  And my estate deserves an heir more raised
  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
  For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MDCXXXVIII - "OMWHENCEATPLEA"

  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  My fortunes to your service, which are here
  Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
  He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
  There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.


MDCXXXIX - "SURETHOUMAYSTC"

  Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
  Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
  My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
  And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
  The need we have to use you did provoke
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.


MDCXL - "OMEANDPARTANDE"

  O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
  Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
  And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  To raise my state to title of a queen,
  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?


MDCXLI - "VENTHENCETHOUW"

  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
  That shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Had the full view of, such a noise arose
  Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.


MDCXLII - "ILTBESTOLNIFEA"

  I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  Let's have your company, or, if you please,
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  Before the curing of a strong disease,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  For she is sweeter than perfume itself
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And not be Richard that hath done all this.


MDCXLIII - "RFORTRUTHPROVE"

  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  That nightly lie in those unproper beds
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MDCXLIV - "STHIEVISHFORAP"

  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
  See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
  Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
  Please you draw near. Louder the music there!


MDCXLV - "RIZESODEARAGAI"

  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
  Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
  Only make trial what your love can do
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
  If happy England's royal king be free.


MDCXLVI - "NSTTHATTIMEIFE"

  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
  To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
  The advised head defends itself at home;
  He well may be a stranger, for he comes
  A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  The interruption of their churlish drums
  To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
  Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
  Mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  If he do break the smallest particle
  Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MDCXLVII - "VERTHATTIMECOM"

  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  That may repeat and history his los
  Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
  And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  To think their dolour others have endured.
  I was of late as petty to his ends
  More worth than any man; men, that she is
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
  O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
  Much danger do I undergo for thee.


MDCXLVIII - "EWHENISHALLSEE"

  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
  How fine my master is! I am afraid
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
  Increase your services; so seem as if
  Set him before me; let me see his face.
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  A time before we came unto this cell?
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
  See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MDCXLIX - "THEEFROWNONMYD"

  Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
  High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  For well I wot the empress never wags
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
  Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
  Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Now does my project gather to a head:
  My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
  Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?


MDCL - "EFECTSWHENASTH"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  France friend with England, what becomes of me?
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
  Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
  Should of another therefore be abused!
  Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
  A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
  His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.


MDCLI - "YLOVEHATHCASTH"

  Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
  Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
  This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
  Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
  Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
  And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;
  Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
  How many years a mortal man may live.


MDCLII - "ISUTMOSTSUMCAL"

  I do beseech you, either not believe
  Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
  My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
  Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  That, notwithstanding thy capacity
  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
  Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.


MDCLIII - "LDTOTHATAUDITB"

  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  Deal between thee and me! for even now
  That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
  Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
  Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Then to your offices and let me rest.
  And live the purer with the other half,
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  The cause of his arrival here in arms:
  But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.


MDCLIV - "YADVISEDRESPEC"

  You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
  And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
  Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
  Pinched with the colic, you make faces like
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.


MDCLV - "TSAGAINSTTHATT"

  They say, she hath abjured the company
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
  To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
  Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
  How can my Muse want subject to invent,
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
  The king is full of grace and fair regard.


MDCLVI - "IMEWHENTHOUSHA"

  I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
  My mind will never grant what I perceive
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  The primogenitive and due of birth,
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
  All this away and me most wretched make.


MDCLVII - "LTSTRANGELYPAS"

  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
  To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Are made already mothers: by my count,
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
  Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
  Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
  Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
  Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?


MDCLVIII - "SANDSCARCELYGR"

  Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
  And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
  Now will we take some order in the town,
  Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
  She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,
  Come from the north; and as I came along
  And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
  Yet there's as little justice as at land:
  Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MDCLIX - "EETMEWITHTHATS"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
  Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Which I so lively acted with my tears
  It hath been taught us from the primal state,
  To tell them that this world did equal theirs
  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
  Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
  Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
  A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.


MDCLX - "UNTHINEEYEWHEN"

  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
  He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
  I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  You have a double tongue within your mask,
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!


MDCLXI - "LOVECONVERTEDF"

  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Other course you please, which the time shall more
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?


MDCLXII - "ROMTHETHINGITW"

  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
  Methought I had; and often did I strive
  To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
  I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  I lost my liberty and they their lives.
  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
  Which here appeareth due upon the bond.


MDCLXIII - "ASSHALLREASONS"

  At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  He might have bought me at a common price:
  Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
  Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Away with him! and make a fire straight;
  Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
  O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.


MDCLXIV - "FINDOFSETTLEDG"

  For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;
  France is revolted from the English quite,
  Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  To take in many towns ere almost Rome
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.
  Give me your hand and say you will be mine.


MDCLXV - "RAVITYAGAINSTT"

  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  That rheumatic diseases do abound:
  You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
  Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
  Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
  I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
  Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
  She that in wisdom never was so frail
  To stop the inundation of her tears;
  The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.


MDCLXVI - "HATTIMEDOIENSC"

  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
  The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
  The execution of it shall make known.
  I should fight withal, if he be alive.
  My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
  Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.


MDCLXVII - "ONCEMEHEREWITH"

  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Which we will second. When he lies along,
  If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
  To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
  Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.


MDCLXVIII - "INTHEKNOWLEDGE"

  In conflict that you get the sun of them.
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
  Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
  Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  God and his angels guard your sacred throne
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MDCLXIX - "OFMINEOWNDESER"

  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
  For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.
  My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
  I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
  With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
  Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
  Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MDCLXX - "TANDTHISMYHAND"

  Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
  And I have horse will follow where the game
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
  That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
  Him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
  In weeping after this untimely bier.
  Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
  Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
  You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
  And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?


MDCLXXI - "AGAINSTMYSELFU"

  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,
  Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
  I pray thee, let me look on that again.
  Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
  She bids me think how I have been forsworn
  To set a form upon that indigest
  Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  She that would be your wife now ran from you.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
  For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.


MDCLXXII - "PREARTOGUARDTH"

  Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
  O, what authority and show of truth
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  Unless it be to think that she is by
  And not protract with admiration what
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.


MDCLXXIII - "ELAWFULREASONS"

  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
  Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  Love loving not itself none other can.
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  And the device he bears upon his shield
  Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
  Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
  Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.


MDCLXXIV - "ONTHYPARTTOLEA"

  Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
  Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
  This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
  Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
  Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
  Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
  As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
  Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.


MDCLXXV - "VEPOORMETHOUHA"

  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To make a more requital to your love!
  How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  Upon his bad life to make all this good,
  He that had wit would think that I had none,
  And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.


MDCLXXVI - "STTHESTRENGTHO"

  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  The yearly course that brings this day about
  The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
  Her inclination, let him not leave out
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
  The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
  Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
  O, do not slander him, for he is kind.


MDCLXXVII - "FLAWSSINCEWHYT"

  For terror, not to use, in time the rod
  Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
  And when he heard him swear and vow to God
  Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
  Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
  Safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
  Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.
  Your master will be dead ere you return;
  This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.


MDCLXXVIII - "OLOVEICANALLEG"

  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
  Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
  Let him die: sheathe thy impatience, throw cold
  Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.


MDCLXXIX - "ENOCAUSEHOWHEA"

  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
  And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
  O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
  Who needs must know of her departure and
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  After they heard young Arthur was alive?


MDCLXXX - "VYDOIJOURNEYON"

  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
  Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
  Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
  Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
  O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
  Never lacks power to dismiss itself.


MDCLXXXI - "THEWAYWHENWHAT"

  The unreasonable fury of a beast:
  He would have well becomed this place, and graced
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
  And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
  Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
  Which you say adds to nature, is an art
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Nor never did my actions yet commence
  When went there by an age, since the great flood,
  Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
  And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
  They may awake their helps to comfort them.


MDCLXXXII - "ISEEKMYWEARYTR"

  If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
  Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Making another head to fight again.
  Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
  Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And the offender granted scope of speech,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.


MDCLXXXIII - "AVELSENDDOTHTE"

  Although my last: no matter, since I feel
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
  Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
  Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
  Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
  He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
  Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


MDCLXXXIV - "ACHTHATEASEAND"

  All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
  Comes through commissions, which compel from each
  Horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
  To do him wrong or any way impeach
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
  That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And, not without some scandal to yourself,
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
  Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.


MDCLXXXV - "THATREPOSETOSA"

  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
  That taught his son the office of a fowl!
  Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.
  And am I then a man to be beloved?


MDCLXXXVI - "YTHUSFARTHEMIL"

  Your sovereign greatness and authority.
  Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
  Holds from all soldiers chief majority
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?


MDCLXXXVII - "ESAREMEASUREDF"

  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  Show duty, as mistaken all this while
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.


MDCLXXXVIII - "ROMTHYFRIENDTH"

  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  How many things by season season'd are
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
  Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.


MDCLXXXIX - "EBEASTTHATBEAR"

  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  And stand indebted, over and above,
  So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  That we may call it early by and by.
  He shall be executed presently.
  And often reading what contents it bears;
  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
  Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  As or by oath remove or counsel shake
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MDCXC - "SMETIREDWITHMY"

  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
  I something do excuse the thing I hate,
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
  Whereof we have record, trial did draw
  I say the earth did shake when I was born.
  Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
  Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
  My army but a weak and sickly guard;
  Your worth is very dear in my regard.


MDCXCI - "WOEPLODSDULLYO"

  Whose tenors and particular effects
  Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?


MDCXCII - "NTOBEARTHATWEI"

  None wed the second but who killed the first.
  Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  And let our army be discharged too.
  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
  Without all ornament, itself and true,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?


MDCXCIII - "GHTINMEASIFBYS"

  Grief best is pleased with grief's society:
  He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  My way shall be paved with English faces.
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  And little stars shot from their fixed places,
  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
  Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
  Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
  But that one half which is unsatisfied,
  Your right depends not on his life or death.
  Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!


MDCXCIV - "OMEINSTINCTTHE"

  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Met us again and madly bent on us,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,
  To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
  I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
  Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--
  Hereafter, in a better world than this,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MDCXCV - "WRETCHDIDKNOWH"

  We still have judgment here; that we but teach
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  That birds would sing and think it were not night.
  Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
  Her new-built virtue and obedience.
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  In forwarding this dear expedience.
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
  On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
  Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?


MDCXCVI - "ISRIDERLOVEDNO"

  I have no more sons of the royal blood
  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  I doubt not but with honour to redress;
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
  One time or other break some gallows' back.
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!


MDCXCVII - "TSPEEDBEINGMAD"

  To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
  Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
  Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?


MDCXCVIII - "EFROMTHEETHEBL"

  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  My resolution, husband, do thou take;
  There is enough written upon this earth
  Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  The other part reserved I by consent,
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  Either of king or council, when you went
  But in the other's silence do I see
  Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.


MDCXCIX - "OODYSPURCANNOT"

  Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
  O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
  Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
  Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
  Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
  That it will live engraven in my face.


MDCC - "PROVOKEHIMONTH"

  Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
  If ever you have look'd on better days,
  My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
  On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  That my discovery be not aimed at;
  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.


MDCCI - "ATSOMETIMESANG"

  A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  To feed contention in a ling'ring act;
  I would the state of time had first been whole
  Myself and what is mine to you and yours
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
  And free my country from calamity:
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  Go with the princes, or stay here with us?


MDCCII - "ERTHRUSTSINTOH"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
  Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Such commendations as becomes a maid,
  Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
  Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
  The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
  Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
  How came you in these parts? where were you bred?


MDCCIII - "ISHIDEWHICHHEA"

  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
  He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
  I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
  Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
  I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
  Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!


MDCCIV - "VILYHEANSWERSW"

  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  And my imaginations are as foul
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
  Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
  With colours fairer painted their foul ends.


MDCCV - "ITHAGROANMORES"

  If you had known the virtue of the ring,
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
  And what love can do that dares love attempt;
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  A visor for a visor! what care I
  Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?


MDCCVI - "HARPTOMETHANSP"

  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
  One time or other break some gallows' back.
  My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
  Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
  Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.


MDCCVII - "URRINGTOHISSID"

  Upon the country where you make abode;
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
  Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
  Some offer me commodities to buy:
  Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
  If any such be here--as God forbid!--
  Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.


MDCCVIII - "EFORTHATSAMEGR"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Free from these slanders and this open shame!
  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
  Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
  Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.
  Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
  Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
  And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!


MDCCIX - "OANDOTHPUTTHIS"

  One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
  And let Bianca take her sister's room.
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
  He is a great observer and he looks
  Presume not that I am the thing I was,
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  That he would labour my delivery.
  These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
  He likewise gives a frock or livery,
  I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?


MDCCX - "INMYMINDMYGRIE"

  I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
  No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
  Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
  You of my household, leave this peevish broil
  My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
  I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  If you bethink yourself of any crime
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MDCCXI - "FLIESONWARDAND"

  From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  If with the sap of reason you would quench,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.
  When he did stand for consul, which he lost
  And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
  Any beginning to this peevish odds;
  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!


MDCCXII - "MYJOYBEHINDTHU"

  My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
  Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  Of seeming sorrow--it is sure your own.
  Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
  But if thy arms be to no other end,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,
  Here at more leisure may your Highness read,
  Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?


MDCCXIII - "SCANMYLOVEEXCU"

  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
  And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
  My speech should fall into such vile success
  You know me well, and herein spend but time
  Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
 eXtorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Counting myself but bad till I be best.
  Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!


MDCCXIV - "SETHESLOWOFFEN"

  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
  Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
  Either of king or council, when you went
  So I at each sad strain will strain a tear,
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
  O, had we never, never hunted there!--
  We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  For I should melt at an offender's tears,
  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  No, madam; we will bring you on your way.


MDCCXV - "CEOFMYDULLBEAR"

  Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
  Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:
  Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
  Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MDCCXVI - "ERWHENFROMTHEE"

  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
  Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  No longer session hold upon my shame,
  For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt
  Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MDCCXVII - "ISPEEDFROMWHER"

  I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
  Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
  Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Depose him in the justice of his cause.
  For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
  Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
  Which to his former strength may be restored
  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MDCCXVIII - "ETHOUARTWHYSHO"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
  What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
  Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
  How irksome is this music to my heart!
  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.


MDCCXIX - "ULDIHASTEMETHE"

  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  I give him you, the noblest that survives,
  Here is a silly stately style indeed!
  As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
  Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
  To any happy messenger from thence.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  To have a thousand with red burning spits
  Here are your sons again; and I must lose
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MDCCXX - "NCETILLIRETURN"

  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
  Conceptions only proper to myself,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
  If you do love me, you will find me out.
  Let us not live in France; let us quit all
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  Is added to her wounds: I think withal
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  This dying virtue, this surviving shame,
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.


MDCCXXI - "OFPOSTINGISNON"

  O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
  From Rome all season'd office and to wind
  Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
  I do protest I never heard of it;
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.


MDCCXXII - "EEDOWHATEXCUSE"

  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  What thing, in honour, had my father lost
  He likewise gives a frock or livery,
  As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
  That he would labour my delivery.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
 eXcepting one, I would he were the best
  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
  Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
  Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MDCCXXIII - "WILLMYPOORBEAS"

  What maintenance he from his friends receives,
  I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
  Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.
  Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  You shall be more beloving than beloved.
  Presume not that I am the thing I was,
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.


MDCCXXIV - "TTHENFINDWHENS"

  Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
  To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
  Here is my hand; the premises observed,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  Fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
  Insinuation, parley and base truce
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
  Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
  He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!


MDCCXXV - "WIFTEXTREMITYC"

  Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
  In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
  For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
  That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
 eXcept some petty towns of no import:
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.
  I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
  There's two of you; the devil make a third!
  You thief of love! what, have you come by night
  Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.


MDCCXXVI - "ANSEEMBUTSLOWT"

  Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
  Nor never did my actions yet commence
  Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Master, it is no time to chide you now;
  But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  To lose so bad employment; in the which
  She marking them begins a wailing note
  Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
  Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
  With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
  The guilty rebel for remission prays.


MDCCXXVII - "HENSHOULDISPUR"

  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  I know, ere they will have me go to ward,
  Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
  Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MDCCXXVIII - "THOUGHMOUNTEDO"

  They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
  Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
  Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?


MDCCXXIX - "NTHEWINDINWING"

  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
  If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
  No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
  I gave it freely ever; and there's none
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
  I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  God give us leisure for these rites of love!


MDCCXXX - "EDSPEEDNOMOTIO"

  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  Such was the very armour he had on
  Painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
  I can no longer brook thy vanities.
  Of Timon man and all humanity!


MDCCXXXI - "NSHALLIKNOWTHE"

  No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
  Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And the remembrancer of her to hold
  Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
  Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
  I now am full resolved to take a wife
  Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
  Nothing to think on but ensuing death:
  Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
  Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  Here to this devil, to deliver you.
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MDCCXXXII - "NCANNOHORSEWIT"

  Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
  Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
  And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
  Offended us you have not, but the king.
  He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
  I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
  Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.


MDCCXXXIII - "HMYDESIREKEEPP"

  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
  My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear;
  Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
  Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  In that each of you have forsworn his book,
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
  Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?


MDCCXXXIV - "ACETHEREFOREDE"

  Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
  Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  The skipping king, he ambled up and down
  How many inches doth fill up one mile.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
  Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MDCCXXXV - "SIREOFPERFECTS"

  Since that my penitence comes after all,
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
  Prove them, and I lie open to the law:
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  For womanish it is to be from thence.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  The unreasonable fury of a beast:
  Suspect still comes where an estate is least.


MDCCXXXVI - "TLOVEBEINGMADE"

  To see her tears; but be your heart to them
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MDCCXXXVII - "SHALLNEIGHNODU"

  Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
  Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
  Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,
  No king of England, if not king of France.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,
  Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
  No leisure had he to enrank his men;
  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
  Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?


MDCCXXXVIII - "LLFLESHINHISFI"

  Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
  La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  I would I could not think it: that thought is
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  For York in justice puts his armour on.
  Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.


MDCCXXXIX - "ERYRACEBUTLOVE"

  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  Your children were vexation to your youth,
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
  Cold death aside, and with the other sends
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
  List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MDCCXL - "FORLOVETHUSSHA"

  For never henceforth shall I joy again,
  Or we are Romans and will give you that
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Thy private feasting to a public fast,
  He that unbuckles this, till we do please
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
  She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
  He's very likely now to fall from him,
  As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.


MDCCXLI - "LLEXCUSEMYJADE"

  Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
  Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
 eXpress'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
  Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
  Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
  Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
  Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear
  And, on my trust, a man that never yet
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MDCCXLII - "SINCEFROMTHEEG"

  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
  May deem that you are worthily deposed.
  Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.


MDCCXLIII - "OINGHEWENTWILF"

  O, but they say the tongues of dying men
  In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
  Who were the motives that you first went out;
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:
  Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!


MDCCXLIV - "ULSLOWTOWARDST"

  Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
  Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
  Which is the ladder to all high designs,
  The hearing of my wife with your approach;
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  What, would you bury him in my despite?
  And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Then let it lie for those that it concerns.


MDCCXLV - "HEEILLRUNANDGI"

  How shall we do for money for these wars?
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Now is this golden crown like a deep well
  All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
  Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
  Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
  I am left out; for me nothing remains.


MDCCXLVI - "VEHIMLEAVETOGO"

  Values itself so highly that to her
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
  If he should break his day, what should I gain
  My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  And I will wish thee never more to dance,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.


MDCCXLVII - "SOAMIASTHERICH"

  Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
  Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
  It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
  And question this most bloody piece of work,
  Save base authority from others' books
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  How much I have disabled mine estate,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!


MDCCXLVIII - "WHOSEBLESSEDKE"

  We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
  Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
  O, torture me no more! I will confess.
  Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  But if I cannot win you to this love,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MDCCXLIX - "YCANBRINGHIMTO"

  Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
  Cool and congeal again to what it was.
  All the occurrence of my fortune since
  Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
  Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
  No longer session hold upon my shame,
  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  Myself and divers gentlemen beside
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!


MDCCL - "HISSWEETUPLOCK"

  How shall I honour thee for this success?
  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
  So shall you share all that he doth possess,
  Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
  Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
  Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
  Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
  Know man from man? dispute his own estate?


MDCCLI - "EDTREASURETHEW"

  England and France might, through their amity,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
  So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
  Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.


MDCCLII - "HICHHEWILLNOTE"

  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
  Consisting equally of horse and foot;
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
  Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace!
  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
  Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MDCCLIII - "VERYHOURSURVEY"

  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
  Upon the heavy middle of the night
  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  You have forgot the will I told you of.


MDCCLIV - "FORBLUNTINGTHE"

  Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
  Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Thy will by my performance shall be served:
  I give to both your speeches, which were such
  No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.
  God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!
  The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MDCCLV - "FINEPOINTOFSEL"

  For forty ducats is too much to lose.
  It is not for your health thus to commit
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
  I will be squared by this. I do believe
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  Of fourteen; I have known thee already.
  For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
  Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.


MDCCLVI - "DOMPLEASURETHE"

  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
  Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
  Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.


MDCCLVII - "REFOREAREFEAST"

  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  And that thy summer bred us no increase,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
  Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
  That oft they interchange each other's seat.


MDCCLVIII - "SSOSOLEMNANDSO"

  She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
  Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  Seeing the deed is meritorious,
  Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
  Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise
  Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
  A Roman and a British ensign wave
  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  So many greedy looks of young and old
  Of physiognomy might one behold!


MDCCLIX - "RARESINCESELDO"

  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  I saw him in the battle range about;
  Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
  Can any face of brass hold longer out?
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  She bears the load of lust he left behind,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  O, torture me no more! I will confess.


MDCCLX - "MCOMINGINTHELO"

  My strong imagination sees a crown
  Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
  If any such be here--as God forbid!--
  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
  Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  That she with painted images hath spent;
  Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Lady, you know no rules of charity,
  Of his self-love, to stop posterity?


MDCCLXI - "NGYEARSETLIKES"

  No! why? When he that is my husband now
  Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
  Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  As one near death to those that wish him live:
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  The insolence of office, and the spurns
  Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.


MDCCLXII - "TONESOFWORTHTH"

  Thou already, that seest not thy loss in
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
  Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
  Thy private feasting to a public fast,
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.


MDCCLXIII - "EYTHINLYPLACED"

  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
  Instead whereof let this supply the room:
  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
  Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
  Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:
  Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
  As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
  Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?


MDCCLXIV - "AREORCAPTAINJE"

  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Counting myself but bad till I be best.
  And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
  As he made semblance of his duty, would
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  Justice with favour have I always done;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?


MDCCLXV - "WELSINTHECARCA"

  With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
  And yet a dispensation may be had.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
  A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.


MDCCLXVI - "NETSOISTHETIME"

  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Their cold intent, tenour, and substance, thus:
  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Take honour from me, and my life is done:
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
  I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
  My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MDCCLXVII - "THATKEEPSYOUAS"

  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
  And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
  To have my praise for this, perform a part
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?


MDCCLXVIII - "MYCHESTORASTHE"

  My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
  His insolence draws folly from my lips;
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
  To those which would not know them, and yet must
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  And lastly, to confirm that amity
  So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  He was not sad, for he would shine on those
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MDCCLXIX - "WARDROBEWHICHT"

  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  If she have time to breathe be well assured
  Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  That some impurity doth not pollute.


MDCCLXX - "HEROBEDOTHHIDE"

  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
  Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  Or if he do, let it at least be said
  That rage in savage sensuality.
  Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
  Here on my knee I beg mortality,
  Is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MDCCLXXI - "TOMAKESOMESPEC"

  Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
  Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
  Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Send for your daughter by your servant here;
  O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
  Prove you that any man with me conversed
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?


MDCCLXXII - "IALINSTANTSPEC"

  I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  I see a better state to me belongs
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
  And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
  So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?


MDCCLXXIII - "IALBLESTBYNEWU"

  Into the market-place: there shall I try
  All the occurrence of my fortune since
  Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
  But you at your sick service had a prince.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  The gravity and stillness of your youth
  But nothing can affection's course control,
  Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.


MDCCLXXIV - "NFOLDINGHISIMP"

  Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
  For hither we have broken in by force.
  O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  I speak amazedly; and it becomes
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  How often said, my dignity would last
  I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
  Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
  I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
  My thoughts aim at a further matter; I
  Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.


MDCCLXXV - "RISONDPRIDEBLE"

  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  No king of England, if not king of France.
  Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
  Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  I have been begging sixteen years in court,
  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  But did you not request to have it cut?
  Like usury, applying wet to wet,
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MDCCLXXVI - "SSEDAREYOUWHOS"

  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
  We know not where you left him all alive;
  His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
  Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
  Some entertainment for them in their tents.


MDCCLXXVII - "EWORTHINESSGIV"

  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  What is your quarrel? how began it first?
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
  Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MDCCLXXVIII - "ESSCOPEBEINGHA"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Should have a back or second, that might hold
  So distribution should undo excess,
  Crush him together rather than unfold
  O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
  People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  I am. What must we understand by this?
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
  And make me happy in your unity.


MDCCLXXIX - "DTOTRIUMPHBEIN"

  Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
  To melt the city leads upon your pates,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  The unity and married calm of states
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
  Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
  More honourable state, more courtship lives
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!


MDCCLXXX - "GLACKDTOHOPEWH"

  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
  Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
  Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.


MDCCLXXXI - "ATISYOURSUBSTA"

  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
  I made to it, to know of whence you are.
  She speaks much of her father; says she hears
  You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
  Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Speak England first, that hath been forward first
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  Broken his staff of office and dispersed
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  The other, that he do record a gift,
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!


MDCCLXXXII - "NCEWHEREOFAREY"

  Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
  Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
  For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
  And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.


MDCCLXXXIII - "OUMADETHATMILL"

  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
  Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
  And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
  The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
  I have made strong proof of my constancy,
  Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
  Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.


MDCCLXXXIV - "IONSOFSTRANGES"

  Is business of estate; in which we come
  On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
  Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
  Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
  For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
  Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?


MDCCLXXXV - "HADOWSONYOUTEN"

  Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
  And question this most bloody piece of work,
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  When I do name him, let it be thy part
  Sister, content you in my discontent.
  O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
  Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.


MDCCLXXXVI - "DSINCEEVERYONE"

  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.
  In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
  Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
  Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
  O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
  Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MDCCLXXXVII - "HATHEVERYONEON"

  How I have ever loved the life removed
  Absolute madness could so far have raved
  That does infect the land: with which they moved
  Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Yet once again, to make us public sport,
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  No man alive can love in such a sort
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.


MDCCLXXXVIII - "ESHADEANDYOUBU"

  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
  And I dare swear you borrow not that face
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.


MDCCLXXXIX - "TONECANEVERYSH"

  Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
  All our merry meetings on the plains,
  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.


MDCCXC - "ADOWLENDDESCRI"

  As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
  Deliver him to safety; and return,
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
  Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
  Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
  Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Should in the furthest east begin to draw
  Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  I did present him with the Paris balls.


MDCCXCI - "BEADONISANDTHE"

  Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
  Did call my father, was I know not where
  O, they love least that let men know their love.
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
  And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
  Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
  Disguise us at my lodging and return,
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MDCCXCII - "COUNTERFEITISP"

  Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Under what colour he commits this ill.
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  For beauty starved with her severity
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
  The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
  I freely told you, all the wealth I had
  Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
  Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!


MDCCXCIII - "OORLYIMITATEDA"

  O, that a mighty man of such descent,
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
  If you will lead these graces to the grave
  This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
  As I all other in all worths surmount.


MDCCXCIV - "FTERYOUONHELEN"

  For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
  That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


MDCCXCV - "SCHEEKALLARTOF"

  Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
  Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
  He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  And thou art wedded to calamity.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  To join your hearts in love and amity.
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  For forth he goes and visits all his host.


MDCCXCVI - "BEAUTYSETANDYO"

  Became the next day's master, till the last
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  That ever spider twisted from her womb
  You may my glories and my state depose,
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
  And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
  You must forsake this room, and go with us:
  O, torture me no more! I will confess.


MDCCXCVII - "UINGRECIANTIRE"

  Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
  I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
  If he improve them, may well stretch so far
  And all things change them to the contrary.
  Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
  Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
  If I be so disgracious in your sight,
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MDCCXCVIII - "SAREPAINTEDNEW"

  She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
  And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
  I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  This staff of honour raught, there let it stand
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?


MDCCXCIX - "SPEAKOFTHESPRI"

  Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
  Proud of employment, willingly I go.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
  Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
  How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!


MDCCC - "NGANDFOISONOFT"

  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
  Never was seen so black a day as this:
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  So please your majesty, I would I could
  Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  For, since the mortal and intestine jars
  Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.


MDCCCI - "HEYEARTHEONEDO"

  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  A thievish living on the common road?
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  O, but they say the tongues of dying men
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.


MDCCCII - "THSHADOWOFYOUR"

  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
  She would to each one sip. You are retired,
  Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
  And let Bianca take her sister's room.
  Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
  Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
  Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


MDCCCIII - "BEAUTYSHOWTHEO"

  Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
  Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
  The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
  You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
  So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  What nearer debt in all humanity
  Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
  Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  O, I am ignorance itself in this!


MDCCCIV - "THERASYOURBOUN"

  Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  A light condition in a beauty dark.
  She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
  But to the earth some special good doth give,
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
  Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.


MDCCCV - "TYDOTHAPPEARAN"

  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
  Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
  Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  And six or seven winters more respect
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.


MDCCCVI - "DYOUINEVERYBLE"

  Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
  Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  You know not what you do: do not consent
  But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
  Loyalty, something fears me to think of.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.


MDCCCVII - "SSEDSHAPEWEKNO"

  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
  Save base authority from others' books
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  See how the morning opes her golden gates,
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  According to the measure of their states.
  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.


MDCCCVIII - "WINALLEXTERNAL"

  Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
  And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
 eXcept a sword or sceptre balance it:
  This reprobate till he were well inclined;
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  Let me my service tender on your lips.


MDCCCIX - "GRACEYOUHAVESO"

  Give him that parting kiss which I had set
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  And many maiden gardens yet unset
  Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  Have moved his highness to commit me now.
  Away, away, good William de la Pole!
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Suddenly made him from my side to start
  O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!


MDCCCX - "MEPARTBUTYOULI"

  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
  As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
  But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
  This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.


MDCCCXI - "KENONENONEYOUF"

  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  One that attends your ladyship's command.
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  For, if you should, O, what would come of it!


MDCCCXII - "ORCONSTANTHEAR"

  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  And ring these fingers with thy household worms
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
  He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  And for I know she taketh most delight
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!


MDCCCXIII - "TOHOWMUCHMORED"

  They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
  Of old Andronicus. And what an if
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
  More that I may call men than you, good friend,
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
  Herself most chastely absent: after this,
  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.


MDCCCXIV - "OTHBEAUTYBEAUT"

  O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  And, being credulous in this mad thought,
  Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
  The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
  Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And bids thee study on what fair demands
  Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
  These but the trappings and the suits of woe.


MDCCCXV - "EOUSSEEMBYTHAT"

  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Misprising what they look on, and her wit
  Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
  The napless vesture of humility;
  Here in my scabbard, meditating that
  And bring me their opinions of success.
  To leave the Talbot and to follow us.


MDCCCXVI - "SWEETORNAMENTW"

  So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled
  Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Never, before this day, in all his life.
  And lookest to command the prince and realm.
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  To fetch me trifles, and return again,
  Which is that god in office, guiding men?


MDCCCXVII - "HICHTRUTHDOTHG"

  How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
  Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
  Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
  He is unqualitied with very shame.
  That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
  They surfeited with honey and began
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  Do it in hope of fair advantages:
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  To match with her that brings no vantages.
  Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
  Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.


MDCCCXVIII - "IVETHEROSELOOK"

  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  The very tyranny and rage of his.
  His daughter's trial! that he did but see
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  Recking as little what betideth me
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  She's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  Only to stick it in their children's sight
  Know him in us, that here hold up his right.


MDCCCXIX - "SFAIRBUTFAIRER"

  Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
  Full of vexation come I, with complaint
  And childish error, that they are afraid;
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Better forbear till Proteus make return.
  Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
  And perfected by the swift course of time.
  In thine own person answer thy abuse.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MDCCCXX - "WEITDEEMFORTHA"

  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  I would not my unhoused free condition
  Take honour from me, and my life is done:
  Do I put up that womanly defence,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  My liege, your highness now may do me good.
  For man or master. Then it follows thus:
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Then, England's messenger, return in post,
  He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
  And with the same to act controlling laws.


MDCCCXXI - "TSWEETODOURWHI"

  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Such as I am: though for myself alone
  Which they upon the adverse party want.
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
  His foes are so enrooted with his friends
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.


MDCCCXXII - "CHDOTHINITLIVE"

  Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
  Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
  To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
  How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
  I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:
  Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  I know they are stuff'd with protestations
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MDCCCXXIII - "THECANKERBLOOM"

  Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
  Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
  A very valiant rebel of the name.
  Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
  Lives not this day within the city walls:
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
  Making another head to fight again.


MDCCCXXIV - "SHAVEFULLASDEE"

  Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
  He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
  And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Letters of commendations to the king.
  And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.
  Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.


MDCCCXXV - "PADYEASTHEPERF"

  Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
  Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.


MDCCCXXVI - "UMEDTINCTUREOF"

  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
  Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
  Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
  For his approach, that often there had been.


MDCCCXXVII - "THEROSESHANGON"

  Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
  He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
  Sir, I propose not merely to myself
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
  As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.


MDCCCXXVIII - "SUCHTHORNSANDP"

  So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
  To-morrow toward London back again,
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  So many journeys may the sun and moon
  Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  Dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
  Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.


MDCCCXXIX - "LAYASWANTONLYW"

  Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
  And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
  Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
  As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
  Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
  What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
  And from thy hated presence part I so:
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
  Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
  Now fear I this will give it start again;
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Your exposition on the holy text
  Well, bury him, and bury me the next.


MDCCCXXX - "HENSUMMERSBREA"

  He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  My desolation does begin to make
  Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
  But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And made a preachment of your high descent?


MDCCCXXXI - "THTHEIRMASKEDB"

  To take that course by your consent and voice,
  How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
  To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  It is the bloody business which informs
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
  Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  But are not some whole that we must make sick?


MDCCCXXXII - "UDSDISCLOSESBU"

  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  I would your grace would take me with you: whom
  Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
  Until the queen his mistress bury it.


MDCCCXXXIII - "TFORTHEIRVIRTU"

  The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
  From any private malice in his end,
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
  He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  I would not my unhoused free condition
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?


MDCCCXXXIV - "EONLYISTHEIRSH"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Other, if she will not discover it.
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Yet I express to you a mother's care:
  I should report that which I say I saw,
  So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
  The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
  His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  If this, or more than this, I would deny,
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
  He lies not like the living. O my heart!


MDCCCXXXV - "OWTHEYLIVEUNWO"

  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
  Lesser his person than an ill report;
  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
  Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.


MDCCCXXXVI - "ODANDUNRESPECT"

  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Depart again: here, here will I remain
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Nature should be so conversant with pain,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!


MDCCCXXXVII - "EDFADEDIETOTHE"

  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
  For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.
  Or that or any place that harbours men.
  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MDCCCXXXVIII - "MSELVESSWEETRO"

  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Which yet from her by no means can I get.
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!


MDCCCXXXIX - "SESDONOTSOOFTH"

  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
  O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
  The labour of each knight in his device.
  Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
  Only thus much I give your grace to know:
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
  The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
  Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.


MDCCCXL - "EIRSWEETDEATHS"

  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
  Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  And when in his fair parts she did abide,
  There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
  How insolent of late he is become,
  Shallow. A better instance, I say; come.


MDCCCXLI - "ARESWEETESTODO"

  Against all sense you do importune her:
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  We do instate and widow you withal,
  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Say, if my father render fair return,
  That blow did that it from the deep unrest
  Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  O, pity, God, this miserable age!


MDCCCXLII - "URSMADEANDSOOF"

  Unto another lady of esteem:
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
  And very well appointed, as I thought,
  During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  And made her widow to a woful bed?
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
  For forth he goes and visits all his host.


MDCCCXLIII - "YOUBEAUTEOUSAN"

  Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill;
  Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  But that my heart's on future mischief set,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  The noble duke hath been too much abused.
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MDCCCXLIV - "DLOVELYYOUTHWH"

  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  O Antony, beg not your death of us.
  Upon mine honour, he shall never know
  That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
  Her mother hath many times told me so.
  Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
  How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!


MDCCCXLV - "ENTHATSHALLFAD"

  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
  He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
  And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
  The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
  And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
  Levy great sums of money through the realm
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?


MDCCCXLVI - "EMYVERSEDISTIL"

  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
  So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
  I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
  Let them want nothing that my house affords.


MDCCCXLVII - "LSYOURTRUTHNOT"

  Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
  The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!


MDCCCXLVIII - "MARBLENORTHEGI"

  May all to Athens back again repair
  And for alliance sake, declare the cause
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
  He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
  I will speak daggers to her, but use none.


MDCCCXLIX - "LDEDMONUMENTSO"

  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
  My royal father, cheer these noble lords
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Nature should be so conversant with pain,
  There, where your argosies with portly sail,
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.


MDCCCL - "FPRINCESSHALLO"

  For all my reign hath been but as a scene
  Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
  He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
  And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
  Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
  Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.


MDCCCLI - "UTLIVETHISPOWE"

  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  I would not be ambitious in my wish,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
  Have you not made an universal shout,
  I think you are all mated or stark mad.
  Shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
  Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
  When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.


MDCCCLII - "RFULRHYMEBUTYO"

  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
  Unto the king be by, and then his state
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
  You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
  Much like a press of people at a door,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
  Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
  The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.


MDCCCLIII - "USHALLSHINEMOR"

  Under these hard conditions as this time
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
  And fawn on rage with base humility,
  Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,
  Let fair humanity abhor the deed
  Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
  He has his health and ampler strength indeed
  It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
  Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.


MDCCCLIV - "EBRIGHTINTHESE"

  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  I pray you take me up, and bear me hence
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  That all the world besides methinks are dead.
  Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  That should be in a Roman you do want,
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MDCCCLV - "CONTENTSTHANUN"

  Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  A Roman now adopted happily,
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  Unless the master were the man. How now!
  Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.


MDCCCLVI - "SWEPTSTONEBESM"

  So distribution should undo excess,
  What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
  She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
  This evening, on the east side of the grove.
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  But when he frown'd, it was against the French
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.


MDCCCLVII - "EARDWITHSLUTTI"

  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
  Instead whereof let this supply the room:
  That very envy and the tongue of loss
  How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
  Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Thus will I fold them one on another:
  To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
  In courtesy gives undeserving praise.


MDCCCLVIII - "SHTIMEWHENWAST"

  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  When love, converted from the thing it was,
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:
  As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  Thou losest here, a better where to find.


MDCCCLIX - "EFULWARSHALLST"

  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
  Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
  Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
  We may the number of the ships behold,
  And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.
  Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
  Than I by letters shall direct your course.


MDCCCLX - "ATUESOVERTURNA"

  Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
  To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
  One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  Unless the master were the man. How now!
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.


MDCCCLXI - "NDBROILSROOTOU"

  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  Despoiled of your honour in your life,
  But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
  Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  Shall then my father's will be of no force
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


MDCCCLXII - "TTHEWORKOFMASO"

  To carry that which I would have refused,
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
  Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
  My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
  As love is full of unbefitting strains,
  She will attend it better in thy youth
  Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.


MDCCCLXIII - "NRYNORMARSHISS"

  Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
  No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
  All you that see her, that she were a maid,
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
  If that your moody discontented souls
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Still live they and for ever may they last!


MDCCCLXIV - "WORDNORWARSQUI"

  When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
  O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
  And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
  Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.


MDCCCLXV - "CKFIRESHALLBUR"

  Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
  Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
  Four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
  I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  Being but fourth of that heroic line.
  Undoing all, as all had never been!
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?


MDCCCLXVI - "NTHELIVINGRECO"

  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
  How many make the hour full complete;
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
  If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Commanded always by the greater gust;
  On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.


MDCCCLXVII - "RDOFYOURMEMORY"

  Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
  Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
  Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
  O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Younger than she are happy mothers made.


MDCCCLXVIII - "GAINSTDEATHAND"

  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
  I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  And we are barren and bereft of friends;
  The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And will again commit them to their bonds,
  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
  Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.


MDCCCLXIX - "ALLOBLIVIOUSEN"

  As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
  Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
  But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  I came before you here a man prepared
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
  O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.


MDCCCLXX - "MITYSHALLYOUPA"

  Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  They will digest this harsh indignity.
  You less know how to value her desert
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  And knows not how to do it but with tears.
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  Presume not that I am the thing I was,
  Alas the day! I never gave him cause.


MDCCCLXXI - "CEFORTHYOURPRA"

  Came short of composition, but in chief
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  For nothing had begot my something grief;
  Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
  Her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
  Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
  Omitted, all the voyage of their life
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.


MDCCCLXXII - "ISESHALLSTILLF"

  Into the purse of rich prosperity
  Say what I think of it, since I have found
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
  His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
  A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
  Love to myself and to no love beside.
  Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
  Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
  Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
  I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
  Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!


MDCCCLXXIII - "INDROOMEVENINT"

  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
  I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.


MDCCCLXXIV - "HEEYESOFALLPOS"

  How that the guilty kindred of the queen
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  You shall know all that you are like to know.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
  O, that's as much as you would be denied
  For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
  Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
  O good Horatio, what a wounded name
  Stand in his face to contradict his claim.


MDCCCLXXV - "TERITYTHATWEAR"

  Than this is all as true as it is strange:
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  The manage of my state; as at that time
  Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  And not protract with admiration what
  The life, the right and truth of all this realm
  Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Abate thy valour in the acting it.
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.


MDCCCLXXVI - "THISWORLDOUTTO"

  These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
  I will requite you with as good a thing;
  So much against the mettle of your sex,
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
  That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MDCCCLXXVII - "THEENDINGDOOMS"

  That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
  His present reconciliation take;
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
  It is religion that doth make vows kept;
  Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
  Give even way unto my rough affairs;
  Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
  Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
  O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
  Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
  She is not for your turn, the more my grief.


MDCCCLXXVIII - "OTILLTHEJUDGME"

  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  Then I degraded you from being king,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  Man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MDCCCLXXIX - "NTTHATYOURSELF"

  No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
  He is no less than what we say he is.
  As fancy values them; but with true prayers
  The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Let me be no assistant for a state,
  For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!


MDCCCLXXX - "ARISEYOULIVEIN"

  Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
  Rest on my word, and let not discontent
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
  O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  It is impossible that ever Rome
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


MDCCCLXXXI - "THISANDDWELLIN"

  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
  I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  And therein do account myself well paid:
  Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
  With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  I will converse with iron-witted fools
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.


MDCCCLXXXII - "LOVERSEYESSWEE"

  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  You would have been contracted to a maid;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MDCCCLXXXIII - "TLOVERENEWTHYF"

  This same should be the voice of Friar John.
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  What nearer debt in all humanity
  That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:
  York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;
  For wise men say it is the wisest course.


MDCCCLXXXIV - "ORCEBEITNOTSAI"

  O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
  To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
  To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
  Such men as he be never at heart's ease
  And your great love to me restrains you thus:
  I think he will stand very strong with us.


MDCCCLXXXV - "DTHYEDGESHOULD"

  Disguise the holy strength of their command,
  To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
  Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  God hold it, to your honour's good content!
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  How white and red each other did destroy!
  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
  Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.


MDCCCLXXXVI - "BLUNTERBETHANA"

  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
  The little number of your doubtful friends.
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  But let desert in pure election shine,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
  He on her belly falls, she on her back.
  Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
  No further halting: satisfy me home
  And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.


MDCCCLXXXVII - "PPETITEWHICHBU"

  Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Though no man be assur'd what grace to find,
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
  He sought to murder: but her better stars
  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
  Come, let us go: we will include all jars
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.


MDCCCLXXXVIII - "TTODAYBYFEEDIN"

  Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
  To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
  Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
  Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
  But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
  Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:
  Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.


MDCCCLXXXIX - "GISALLAYDTOMOR"

  Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
  In the remorseless wrinkles of his face;
  Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
  And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;
  Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
  You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.


MDCCCXC - "ROWSHARPENDINH"

  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  O, but remember this another day,
  Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:
  His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
  As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Patience is scottish, and impatience does
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  His folly to the mettle of my speech?


MDCCCXCI - "ISFORMERMIGHTS"

  I was adopted heir by his consent:
  Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
  From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
  I have perform'd my task and was espoused:
  Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
  His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  So is it in the music of men's lives.


MDCCCXCII - "OLOVEBETHOUALT"

  O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
  He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.


MDCCCXCIII - "HOUGHTODAYTHOU"

  His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
  Thus far into the bowels of the land
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
  All the occurrence of my fortune since
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
  How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.


MDCCCXCIV - "FILLTHYHUNGRYE"

  For what I will, I will, and there an end.
  It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
  Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Try many, all good, serve truly, never
  How white and red each other did destroy!
  You're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
  He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
  Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
  Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MDCCCXCV - "YESEVENTILLTHE"

  You would have thought the very windows spake,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  That fell away have entertainment, but
  Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
  Lives not this day within the city walls:
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
  Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MDCCCXCVI - "YWINKWITHFULLN"

  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  When my dimensions are as well compact,
  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd wound.
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  This let alone will all the rest confound.
  Hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
  Let it not enter in your mind of love:
  No more than I am well acquitted of.


MDCCCXCVII - "ESSTOMORROWSEE"

  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
  My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MDCCCXCVIII - "AGAINANDDONOTK"

  Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  All's not offence that indiscretion finds
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
  Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
  Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
  Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
  Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.


MDCCCXCIX - "ILLTHESPIRITOF"

  If it were so, I might have let alone
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  I do not greatly care to be deceived,
  That I, unworthy body as I am,
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?


MCM - "LOVEWITHAPERPE"

  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
  I see my reputation is at stake
  The dearer by I know how much an ounce.
  Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
  A day in April never came so sweet,
  Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MCMI - "TUALDULLNESSLE"

  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  And to your quick-conceiving discontents
  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
  Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
  Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
  Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
  Else would he never so demean himself.


MCMII - "TTHISSADINTERI"

  Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
  That all the world shall- I will do such things-
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  Is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
  In the vile prison of afflicted breath.


MCMIII - "MLIKETHEOCEANB"

  My resolution, husband, do thou take;
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
  Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
  Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
  Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  As if the golden fee for which I plead
  Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
  But shall we wear these honours for a day?


MCMIV - "EWHICHPARTSTHE"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
  His present and your pains we thank you for:
  In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
  Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
  And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
  See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
  That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
  He came too late, the ship was under sail:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MCMV - "SHOREWHERETWOC"

  Surely, by all the glory you have won,
  Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
  Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Either of king or council, when you went
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
  Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
  Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?


MCMVI - "ONTRACTEDNEWCO"

  O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
  Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
  That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
  Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  With whom I am accused, I do confess
  Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.


MCMVII - "MEDAILYTOTHEBA"

  My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
  The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
  And I will fill them with prophetic tears.


MCMVIII - "NKSTHATWHENTHE"

  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
  Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  The picture of an angry-chafing boar,
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MCMIX - "YSEERETURNOFLO"

  You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;
  So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MCMX - "VEMOREBLESTMAY"

  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
  Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
  The city ports by this hath enter'd and
  Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
  And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.


MCMXI - "BETHEVIEWELSEC"

  Between the promise of his greener days
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  When shall he think to find a stranger just,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
  She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.


MCMXII - "ALLITWINTERWHI"

  A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  Let him have time of Time's help to despair,
  If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
  To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
  With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
  Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
  I am not bid to wait upon this bride.


MCMXIII - "CHBEINGFULLOFC"

  Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:
  Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
  For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
  Coming and going with thy honey breath.


MCMXIV - "AREMAKESSUMMER"

  Away, I do beseech you, both away
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MCMXV - "SWELCOMETHRICE"

  She is a theme of honour and renown,
  Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
  Or, if she be accused in true report,
  Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
  Come when the king doth to my lady come;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MCMXVI - "MOREWISHDMORER"

  My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,
  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  When he would play the noble beast in love.
  I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
  On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MCMXVII - "AREBEINGYOURSL"

  Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
  One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.


MCMXVIII - "AVEWHATSHOULDI"

  Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
  Have here bereft my brother of his life.
  Actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
  To separate the husband and the wife.
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
  O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?


MCMXIX - "DOBUTTENDUPONT"

  Do me the favour to dilate at full
  Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
  Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
  Under what colour he commits this ill.
  To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.


MCMXX - "HEHOURSANDTIME"

  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Summon a session, that we may arraign
  A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MCMXXI - "SOFYOURDESIREI"

  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
  You had but that opinion of yourself
  O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
  Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
  I freely told you, all the wealth I had
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.


MCMXXII - "HAVENOPRECIOUS"

  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  As I upon advantage did remove,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Of threescore and two years; a silly time
  Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  It is determined, not concluded yet:
  Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?


MCMXXIII - "TIMEATALLTOSPE"

  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  As never did the clergy at one time
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
  That proof is call'd impossibility.
  O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MCMXXIV - "NDNORSERVICEST"

  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Step forth mine advocate; at your request
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
  Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!


MCMXXV - "ODOTILLYOUREQU"

  O that there were some virtue in my tears,
  Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
  O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
  In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
  Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


MCMXXVI - "IRENORDAREICHI"

  I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
  Remember since you owed no more to time
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
  A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Either of king or council, when you went
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
  Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
  Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
  I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.


MCMXXVII - "DETHEWORLDWITH"

  Doth by the idle comments that it makes
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  That with the hurly death itself awakes?
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
  Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
  I was not much afeard; for once or twice
  The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
  Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.


MCMXXVIII - "OUTENDHOURWHIL"

  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  That can I witness; and a fouler fact
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Deservedly confined into this rock,
  How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  We do not act that often jest and laugh;
  How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
  If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.


MCMXXIX - "STIMYSOVEREIGN"

  Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
  There would have been a time for such a word.
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
  Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
  You are, I think, assur'd I love you not.
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
  God knows how long it is I have to live;
  Not he which says the dead is not alive.


MCMXXX - "WATCHTHECLOCKF"

  Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
  And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
  To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
  Curate and your sweet self are good at such
  Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet
  That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
  Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
  Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,
  Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
  Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
  Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!


MCMXXXI - "ORYOUNORTHINKT"

  One that hath ever been God's enemy:
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
  O heavy times, begetting such events!
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
  Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
  In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
  Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
  Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
  The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.


MCMXXXII - "HEBITTERNESSOF"

  He could not stay to pick them in a pile
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
  I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
  Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
  That which I durst not speak; his present gift
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?


MCMXXXIII - "ABSENCESOURWHE"

  Appointed to direct these fair designs.
  But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
  Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  So are they all, all honourable men--
  Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
  He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MCMXXXIV - "NYOUHAVEBIDYOU"

  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  Yea the illiterate, that know not how
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
  And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  Under whose government come they along?


MCMXXXV - "RSERVANTONCEAD"

  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
  Or if he do, let it at least be said
  Not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
  Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
  England, bound in with the triumphant sea
  And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
  Delivered up again with peaceful words?


MCMXXXVI - "IEUNORDAREIQUE"

  Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  Of that and all the progress, more or less,
  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
  Richly in two short hours. Only they
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
  Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MCMXXXVII - "STIONWITHMYJEA"

  Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
  To wail his death who lives and must not die
  I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
  O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
  Into her womb convey sterility;
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
  My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
  Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Alas, the way is wearisome and long!


MCMXXXVIII - "LOUSTHOUGHTWHE"

  Love loving not itself none other can.
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Unless he live until he be a man.
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  To make a shaking fever in your walls,
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
  Transported, with no worse nor better guard
  Ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
  He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MCMXXXIX - "REYOUMAYBEORYO"

  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  You saw one here in court could witness it.
  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  And dispossessing all my other parts
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
  Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
  O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!


MCMXL - "URAFFAIRSSUPPO"

  Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
  Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
  Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  And where my liege's? all about the breast:
  I do not without danger walk these streets:
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
  Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.


MCMXLI - "SEBUTLIKEASADS"

  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  But that the scambling and unquiet time
  Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
  I greatly fear my money is not safe.
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
  Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
  And one day in a week to touch no food
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.


MCMXLII - "LAVESTAYANDTHI"

  Love loving not itself none other can.
  And ask remission for my folly past.
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Say, if my father render fair return,
  The king is not himself, but basely led
  And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
  Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
  And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
  Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.


MCMXLIII - "NKOFNOUGHTSAVE"

  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
  O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
  Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
  That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MCMXLIV - "WHEREYOUAREHOW"

  When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.
  His other agents aim at like delight?
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Hearing applause and universal shout,
  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
  Wanting the manage of unruly jades.


MCMXLV - "HAPPYYOUMAKETH"

  Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
  And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
  Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
  Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  You never spoke what did become you less
  Outside or inside, I will not return
  Unto your Grace do I in chief address
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  The rather for I have some sport in hand
  How many be commanded that command!


MCMXLVI - "OSESOTRUEAFOOL"

  O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
  Say what I think of it, since I have found
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
  Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
  To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
  For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
  Or bid me go into a new-made grave
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!


MCMXLVII - "ISLOVETHATINYO"

  I think her old familiar is asleep:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
  About that which concerns your grace and us;
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  I doubt not but with honour to redress;
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!


MCMXLVIII - "URWILLTHOUGHYO"

  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Like madness is the glory of this life.
  Let liberty make use of; space enough
  The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Of a glad father compass thee about!
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Going to find a bare-foot brother out
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.


MCMXLIX - "UDOANYTHINGHET"

  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
  Not working with the eye without the ear,
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  I am so far from granting thy request
  Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
  Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
  Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?


MCML - "HINKSNOILLTHAT"

  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Or whether 'twas report of her success;
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Less impudence to gainsay what they did
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
  The small'st opinion on my least misuse?


MCMLI - "GODFORBIDTHATM"

  Good King, that must approve the common saw,
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
  From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  But this is worshipful society
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
  There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.


MCMLII - "ADEMEFIRSTYOUR"

  As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
  Deservedly confined into this rock,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
  You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MCMLIII - "SLAVEISHOULDIN"

  Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
  Less valiant than the virgin in the night
  And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
  Such danger to resistance did belong,
  Horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
  O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  Let villany itself forswear't. I must
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  I better brook the loss of brittle life
  Nothing in France, until he have no wife!


MCMLIV - "THOUGHTCONTROL"

  The heat I have from thence doth little harm,
  He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
  Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
  Though other things grow fair against the sun,
  Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


MCMLV - "YOURTIMESOFPLE"

  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  The leperous distilment; whose effect
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
  Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
  Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
  Presume not that I am the thing I was,
  Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
  Expecting in return twenty for one?


MCMLVI - "ASUREORATYOURH"

  After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
  So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  One that made means to come by what he hath,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
  The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  Or, being open, put into his hands
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
  How long within this wood intend you stay?


MCMLVII - "ANDTHEACCOUNTO"

  Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
  Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
  Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  The other lords, like lions wanting food,
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!


MCMLVIII - "FHOURSTOCRAVEB"

  For here I read for certain that my ships
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  But they can see a sort of traitors here.


MCMLIX - "EINGYOURVASSAL"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  I never swore this lady such an oath.
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
  Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
  Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!


MCMLX - "BOUNDTOSTAYYOU"

  By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
  Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
  And put you in the catalogue of those
  Your sauciness will jest upon my love
  You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
  O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.


MCMLXI - "RLEISUREOLETME"

  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  I see things too, although you judge I wink.
  So full of dismal terror was the time!
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
  Leave off discourse of disability:
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  That, from the sense of all civility,
  Making no summer of another's green,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MCMLXII - "SUFFERBEINGATY"

  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
  Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
  Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!


MCMLXIII - "OURBECKTHEIMPR"

  Omitting the sweet benefit of time
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  That as a waist doth girdle you about,
  He would show most love. When yet he was but
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
  May we not get access to her, my lord?
  Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?


MCMLXIV - "ISONDABSENCEOF"

  I will be thine; and till that instant shut
  So is it not with me as with that Muse
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
  Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
  And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
  She is as forward of her breeding as
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  For he that interrupts him shall not live.


MCMLXV - "YOURLIBERTYAND"

  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
  Your father's heir must have your father's land.
  Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
  Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
  Deadly divorce step between me and you!


MCMLXVI - "PATIENCETAMETO"

  Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
  At this encounter do so much admire
  The tears have got small victory by that;
  Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  They will digest this harsh indignity.
  And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
  Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.


MCMLXVII - "SUFFERANCEBIDE"

  She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
  Fold in the object that did feed her sight.
  For he was fitter for that place than earth.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  And FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  Commend me to your honourable wife:
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  But thou dost in thy passages of life
  I was your mother much upon these years
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MCMLXVIII - "EACHCHEQUEWITH"

  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
  How easy dost thou take all England up!
  Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,
  Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
  In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
  The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
  His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.


MCMLXIX - "OUTACCUSINGYOU"

  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  To cavil in the course of this contract:
  And makes him roar these accusations forth.
  Cowards die many times before their deaths;
  Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
  Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
  So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  I am so angry at these abject terms;
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
  Obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!


MCMLXX - "OFINJURYBEWHER"

  Of woman in me: now from head to foot
  For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
  Upon some present business of the state
  Receiving nought by elements so slow
  You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
  But thou didst understand me by my signs
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Would make a volume of enticing lines,
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MCMLXXI - "EYOULISTYOURCH"

  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
  I will bring in the empress and her sons,
  See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
  The fountain from the which my current runs,
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  CORIOLANUS!
  How shall I honour thee for this success?


MCMLXXII - "ARTERISSOSTRON"

  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  Save base authority from others' books
  Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
  Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
  To whom the foragers shall all repair,
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  O good Horatio, what a wounded name
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?


MCMLXXIII - "GTHATYOUYOURSE"

  Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
  You give away myself, which is known mine;
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
  On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MCMLXXIV - "LFMAYPRIVILEGE"

  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  From whence he intercepted did return
  More health and happiness betide my liege
  And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
  You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MCMLXXV - "YOURTIMETOWHAT"

  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  Of golden metal that must round my brow
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  That excellent complexion, which did steal
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
  One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
  Whose deed hath made herself herself detest:
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  All's not offence that indiscretion finds
  To be oppos'd against the warring winds?


MCMLXXVI - "YOUWILLTOYOUIT"

  Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
  Of disobedient opposition
  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
  The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
  O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
  You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
  Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  If with the sap of reason you would quench,
  To feast upon whole thousands of the French.


MCMLXXVII - "DOTHBELONGYOUR"

  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
  To have his pomp and all what state compounds
  Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ
  But now the mindful messenger, come back,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MCMLXXVIII - "SELFTOPARDONOF"

  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
  Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns
  O constancy, be strong upon my side,
  Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
  And blood untainted still doth red abide,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Did give him that same royalty he wears;
  O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.


MCMLXXIX - "SELFDOINGCRIME"

  Something I must do to procure me grace.
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
  It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
  Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
  Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,
  Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
  My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MCMLXXX - "IAMTOWAITTHOUG"

  Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
  A Roman now adopted happily,
  Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
  The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.


MCMLXXXI - "HWAITINGSOBEHE"

  Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
  Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
  I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
  Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
  If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;
  O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
  But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MCMLXXXII - "LLNOTBLAMEYOUR"

  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
  To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
  Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
  Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
  Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
  Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  You were conducted to a gentle bath
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!


MCMLXXXIII - "PLEASUREBEITIL"

  Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
  Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  But miserable most, to love unloved?
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.


MCMLXXXIV - "LORWELLIFTHERE"

  Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  I tender so the safety of my liege.
  Finding myself in honour so forbid,
  To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MCMLXXXV - "BENOTHINGNEWBU"

  By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Never so little show of love to her,
  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
  They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
  Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
  By this time, had the king permitted us,
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.


MCMLXXXVI - "TTHATWHICHISHA"

  That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
  To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
  Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;
  Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
  Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
  Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
  If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
  Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
  He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
  And more such days as these to us befall!


MCMLXXXVII - "THBEENBEFOREHO"

  The lord protector lost it, and not I:
  Hover about her; say, that right for right
  Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  But that my master rather play'd than fought
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
  Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.


MCMLXXXVIII - "WAREOURBRAINSB"

  While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  Receive the sentence of the law for sins
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  By computation and mine host's report.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
  In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
  No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
  Say their great enemy is gone, and they
  But they will quake and tremble all this day.


MCMLXXXIX - "EGUILEDWHICHLA"

  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Good king, to be so mightily abused!
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  I never heard a passion so confused,
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
  Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
  He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
  Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
  Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
  Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
  And now her sobs do her intendments break.


MCMXC - "BOURINGFORINVE"

  By reason of his adversary's odds:
  Omitting the sweet benefit of time
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
  From first to last, the onset and retire
  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MCMXCI - "NTIONBEARAMISS"

  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
  To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  Borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And make me as the poorest vassal is,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Are visibly character'd and engraved,
  More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
  It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
  Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
  Seven? why, there were but four even now.


MCMXCII - "THESECONDBURDE"

  To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
  He made you for a highway to my bed;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
  But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MCMXCIII - "NOFAFORMERCHIL"

  Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
  O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
  Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
  As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
  For, look you, I may make the belly smile
  Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  My grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
  He sends you this most memorable line,
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.


MCMXCIV - "DOTHATRECORDCO"

  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  Or your own honour to contain the ring,
  To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
  He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
  All is the fear and nothing is the love;
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Cousin of York, we institute your grace
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  Descended of so many royal kings.
  Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.


MCMXCV - "ULDWITHABACKWA"

  Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
  Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  The letter is too long by half a mile.
  Hath set the women on to this complaint:
  And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
  But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
  Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
  Come, let us go: we will include all jars
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
  And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.


MCMXCVI - "RDLOOKEVENOFFI"

  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  O sacred receptacle of my joys,
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
  O master, master I have watch'd so long
  Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
  From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
  I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!


MCMXCVII - "VEHUNDREDCOURS"

  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  He in his speed looks for the morning light;
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
  Do not deny to him that you love me.
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Do more than counterpoise a full third part
  Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
  O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.


MCMXCVIII - "ESOFTHESUNSHOW"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
  The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
  Stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
  Where I espied the panther fast asleep.


MCMXCIX - "MEYOURIMAGEINS"

  My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  I cannot instantly raise up the gross
  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
  And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
  Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.


MM - "OMEANTIQUEBOOK"

  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  And do not spread the compost on the weeds
  Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
  That was and is the question of these wars.
  In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
  Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!


MMI - "SINCEMINDATFIR"

  Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
  I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.
  Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  And all your southern gentlemen in arms
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMII - "STINCHARACTERW"

  Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
  They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
  I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
  Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
  And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
  Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.


MMIII - "ASDONETHATIMIG"

  A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Doth by the idle comments that it makes
  O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
  In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
  Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!


MMIV - "HTSEEWHATTHEOL"

  Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
  The injuries that they themselves procure
  Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And egally indeed to all estates,--
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Observe degree, priority and place,
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.


MMV - "DWORLDCOULDSAY"

  Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
  Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.


MMVI - "TOTHISCOMPOSED"

  That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
  Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
  The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
  He needs no indirect nor lawless course
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
  Can you not see? or will ye not observe
  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
  M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
  Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
  Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
  Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.


MMVII - "WONDEROFYOURFR"

  Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
  Of one or both of us the time is come.
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  O, what a happy title do I find,
  Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.


MMVIII - "AMEWHETHERWEAR"

  A little month, or ere those shoes were old
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
  Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
  Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
  Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.


MMIX - "EMENDEDORWHETH"

  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  More than, I fear, you are provided for.
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
  Here in this country, where we now remain.


MMX - "ERBETTERTHEYOR"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


MMXI - "WHETHERREVOLUT"

  When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
  Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!


MMXII - "IONBETHESAMEOS"

  It is religion that doth make vows kept;
  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
  He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  Should be to be protected like a child.


MMXIII - "UREIAMTHEWITSO"

  Upon my wretched women, that so long
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  It shall be merciful and too severe,
  A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  To be a make-peace shall become my age:
  Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!


MMXIV - "FFORMERDAYSTOS"

  For more than blushing comes to: if your back
  Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
  You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
  So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
  To whom you are but as a form in wax
  O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
  So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.


MMXV - "UBJECTSWORSEHA"

  Unto the crown of France. That you may know
  But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
  The best persuasions to the contrary
  Such and such pictures; there the window; such
  When you have pushed out your gates the very
  Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
  Against the pope and count his friends my foes.


MMXVI - "VEGIVENADMIRIN"

  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  My mother was the daughter of a king;
  If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
  Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.


MMXVII - "GPRAISELIKEAST"

  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  And, by my faith, this league that we have made
  Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
  Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
  If you bethink yourself of any crime
  Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  That labour may you save: see where he comes.


MMXVIII - "HEWAVESMAKETOW"

  Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
  Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
  All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
  Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
  O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
  Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?


MMXIX - "ARDSTHEPEBBLED"

  An honour in him which buys out his fault--
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
  By holy marriage: when and where and how
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Do you not see that I am out of breath?


MMXX - "SHORESODOOURMI"

  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  So sways she level in her husband's heart:
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.


MMXXI - "NUTESHASTENTOT"

  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  As having sense of beauty, do omit
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  This sleep is sound indeed; this is a sleep
  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.


MMXXII - "HEIRENDEACHCHA"

  Hath set the women on to this complaint:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-
  Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  He never was so womanish; the cause
  Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
  How long is't now since last yourself and I
  And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.


MMXXIII - "NGINGPLACEWITH"

  No less in pity than his glory which
  Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
  Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
  Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
  It mourns that painting and usurping hair
  That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
  How many years a mortal man may live.


MMXXIV - "THATWHICHGOESB"

  To make confession and to be absolved.
  He would not answer to: forbad all names;
  Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
  He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
  Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  God grant we never may have need of you!
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
  Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.


MMXXV - "EFOREINSEQUENT"

  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  From fairies and the tempters of the night
  Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  It is the bloody business which informs
  Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.


MMXXVI - "TOILALLFORWARD"

  The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
  One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
  I, now the voice of the recorded law,
  Let it be so: I do commit his youth
  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
  Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
  For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
  Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
  Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.


MMXXVII - "SDOCONTENDNATI"

  So, either by thy picture or my love,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.
  This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
  Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
  I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!


MMXXVIII - "VITYONCEINTHEM"

  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
  That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
  Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  More at your request than to please myself.


MMXXIX - "AINOFLIGHTCRAW"

  As modest stillness and humility:
  I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
  Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Give me the paper; let me read the same;
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  That such immanity and bloody strife
  Come not within his danger by thy will;
  Retaining but a quantity of life,
  And shall she carry this unto her grave?
  What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?


MMXXX - "LSTOMATURITYWH"

  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
  To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
  Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
  Tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
  Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
  Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
  Here on this molehill will I sit me down.


MMXXXI - "EREWITHBEINGCR"

  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
  By humble message and by promised means:
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MMXXXII - "OWNDCROOKEDELI"

  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
  Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
  Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Did steal behind him as he lay along
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  In a light. Yet you see how this world goes.


MMXXXIII - "PSESGAINSTHISG"

  Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  So many journeys may the sun and moon
  Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
  And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
  I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
  The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
  It will outrun you, father, in the end.
  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.


MMXXXIV - "LORYFIGHTANDTI"

  Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
  O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
  For he that brought them, in the very heat
  Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
  The chief perfections of that lovely dame
  In your behalf still will I wear the same.


MMXXXV - "METHATGAVEDOTH"

  Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
  Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
  And never be forgot in mighty Rome
  That make her good? O, let her brother live!
  Go back again, and be new beaten home?
  And that his beauty may the better thrive,
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Do in his name religiously demand
  Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
  To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass
  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.


MMXXXVI - "NOWHISGIFTCONF"

  Not he which says the dead is not alive.
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Which to requite, command me while I live.
  Had not been here to dress the ugly form
  I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
  Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  If I should pay your worship those again,
  Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
  To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
  Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  Now must I to the monument alone;
  From thievish ears, because it is his own?


MMXXXVII - "OUNDTIMEDOTHTR"

  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
  That brings me food to make misfortune live?
  I see I cannot get thy father's love;
  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
  Return again, and take an oath with thee.


MMXXXVIII - "ANSFIXTHEFLOUR"

  An if my face were but as fair as yours,
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  For with the nightly linen that she wears
  It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
 eXpecting in return twenty for one?
  That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;
  Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMXXXIX - "ISHSETONYOUTHA"

  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  So many hours must I tend my flock;
  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Yet have I gold flies from another coast;
  Of what degree soever, with his brother.
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Thus will I fold them one on another:
  He well may be a stranger, for he comes
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!


MMXL - "NDDELVESTHEPAR"

  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
  And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.


MMXLI - "ALLELSINBEAUTY"

  A thing divine, for nothing natural
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
  I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  To bend the fatal instruments of war
  You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.


MMXLII - "SBROWFEEDSONTH"

  See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
  But I will prove that two on's are as good
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
  What says Andronicus to this device?
  For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
  Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
  That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
  Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.


MMXLIII - "ERARITIESOFNAT"

  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
  To be the dowry of a second head,
  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  So then two bosoms and a single troth.
  O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
  To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.


MMXLIV - "URESTRUTHANDNO"

  Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
  To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,
  Reserve their character with golden quill
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  The locks between her chamber and his will,
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  Delighted them in any other form;
  Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
  O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?


MMXLV - "THINGSTANDSBUT"

  Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
  The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;
  As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
  But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.


MMXLVI - "FORHISSCYTHETO"

  For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;
  O, they love least that let men know their love.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
  So I return rebuked to my content
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Of marching to Philippi presently?


MMXLVII - "MOWANDYETTOTIM"

  May yet ere night yield both my life and them
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
  Are of imagination all compact:
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
  Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
  O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
  Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


MMXLVIII - "ESINHOPEMYVERS"

  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
  In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  How calm and gentle I proceeded still
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
  Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.


MMXLIX - "ESHALLSTANDPRA"

  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
  And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
  Love to myself and to no love beside.
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
  Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  A foot of honour better than I was;
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  Dear general, I never gave you cause.
  Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.


MML - "ISINGTHYWORTHD"

  If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
  Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  Though they did change me to the meanest bird
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
  With purpose presently to leave this war.
  O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Had the full view of, such a noise arose
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.


MMLI - "ESPITEHISCRUEL"

  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
  Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
  I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
  So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
  Cousin of York, we institute your grace
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!


MMLII - "HANDISITTHYWIL"

  Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
  Now one the better, then another best;
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
  Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
  Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
  Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
  I take it, she that carries up the train
  Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.


MMLIII - "LTHYIMAGESHOUL"

  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  That grew the more by reaping: his delights
  He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
  Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood.
  May all the building in my fancy pluck
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
  Only for propagation of a dower
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.


MMLIV - "DKEEPOPENMYHEA"

  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  No one but he should be about the king;
  Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
  You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  And we'll strive to please you every day.


MMLV - "VYEYELIDSTOTHE"

  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Impostors to true fear, would well become
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
  The hope and expectation of thy time
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMLVI - "WEARYNIGHTDOST"

  With this regard their currents turn awry
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  And let another half stand laughing by,
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
  That I do brag thus! This your air of France
  Dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
  The burning torch in yonder turret stands.


MMLVII - "THOUDESIREMYSL"

  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
  Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Recking as little what betideth me
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!


MMLVIII - "UMBERSSHOULDBE"

  Unless thou let his silver water keep
  My lady, to the manner of the days,
  Before the always wind-obeying deep
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
  Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
  Until the queen his mistress bury it.
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  But for supporting robbers, shall we now
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMLIX - "BROKENWHILESHA"

  Before the common distribution, at
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
  Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  And yet methinks I do not like this tune.


MMLX - "DOWSLIKETOTHEE"

  Disguise us at my lodging and return,
  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
  Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
  Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  I cannot now prove constant to myself,
  King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  To match with her that brings no vantages.
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Turning past evils to advantages.
  Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMLXI - "DOMOCKMYSIGHTI"

  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
  More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
  O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
  Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
  Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
  She throws her eyes about the painting round,
  If we be English deer, be then in blood;
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
  Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.


MMLXII - "SITTHYSPIRITTH"

  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
  The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
  Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
  Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
  She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
  Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
  I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
  To recreate himself when he hath sung,
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.


MMLXIII - "ATTHOUSENDSTFR"

  As if my brother lived: I partly think
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
  Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
  O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
  Unto the king be by, and then his state
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMLXIV - "OMTHEESOFARFRO"

  Of the most pious Edward with such grace
  My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
  The beauty that is borne here in the face
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
  Of one or both of us the time is come.
  For fly he could not, if he would have fled;
  And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.


MMLXV - "MHOMEINTOMYDEE"

  Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
  Her highness is in safety, fear you not:
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
  Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  My swift command, though I with death and with
  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMLXVI - "DSTOPRYTOFINDO"

  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
  That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
  O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
  Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
  Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
  False to his children or his wife's allies
  I never tempted her with word too large;
  Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  Of this great sport together, as you guess?


MMLXVII - "UTSHAMESANDIDL"

  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
  And if we did but glance a far-off look,
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  And of so easy and so plain a stop
  Now to deliver her possession up
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
  Live cleanly as a nobleman should do.


MMLXVIII - "EHOURSINMETHES"

  Even for revenge mock my destruction!
  His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
  Of thy intents desires instruction,
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  My father is gone wild into his grave,
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  To Italy; and there at Venice gave
  Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.


MMLXIX - "COPEANDTENOROF"

  Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
  Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  Or on Diana's altar to protest
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
  For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.


MMLXX - "THYJEALOUSYONO"

  The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
  He that had wit would think that I had none,
  Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
  Justice with favour have I always done;
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  So many summers dry; scarce any joy
  Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
  On any soul removed but on his own.


MMLXXI - "THYLOVETHOUGHM"

  That give a name to every fixed star
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Yet nature might have made me as these are,
  Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
  He that unbuckles this, till we do please
  O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
  Have moved his highness to commit me now.
  My father had a mole upon his brow.


MMLXXII - "UCHISNOTSOGREA"

  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
  Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
  Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
  So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
  One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And she will speak most bitterly and strange.


MMLXXIII - "TITISMYLOVETHA"

  There let them bide until we have devised
  If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
  Let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
  He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
  And leave no memory of what it was!


MMLXXIV - "TKEEPSMINEEYEA"

  To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
  Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
  Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
  I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
  No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  And better in my mind not undertook.


MMLXXV - "WAKEMINEOWNTRU"

  What you would work me to, I have some aim:
  As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
  Impossible be strange attempts to those
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
  Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
  Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.


MMLXXVI - "ELOVETHATDOTHM"

  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  To meet me at the consecrated fount
  His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
  As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
  That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  This only is the witchcraft I have used:
  His father never was so true begot:
  Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.


MMLXXVII - "YRESTDEFEATTOP"

  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  Touching the jointure that your king must make,
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
  That fell away have entertainment, but
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  One hundred twenty six: added to these,
  Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.


MMLXXVIII - "LAYTHEWATCHMAN"

  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  A Roman now adopted happily,
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
  Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
  How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
  Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
  And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.


MMLXXIX - "EVERFORTHYSAKE"

  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  To mend the petty present, I will piece
  Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
  Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
  So sways she level in her husband's heart:
  And pay no worship to the garish sun.
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


MMLXXX - "FORTHEEWATCHIW"

  For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
  Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
  Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
  Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
  What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?


MMLXXXI - "HILSTTHOUDOSTW"

  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
  Take heed you dally not before your king;
  His deeds with doing them, and is content
  Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
  Unless the master were the man. How now!
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.


MMLXXXII - "AKEELSEWHEREFR"

  As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
  Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  So many blows upon this face of mine,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  With your uncleanness that which is divine;
  How shall this bisson multitude digest
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?


MMLXXXIII - "OMMEFAROFFWITH"

  O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
  My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
  More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  And climb the highest promontory top.
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
  For native blood is counted painting now;
  Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
  I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
  To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
  He is not with himself; let us withdraw.


MMLXXXIV - "OTHERSALLTOONE"

  Of any true decision. Nature craves
  To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
  He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
  Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
  Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
  To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


MMLXXXV - "ARSINOFSELFLOV"

  Absolute madness could so far have raved
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
  In number more than ever women spoke,
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  O, call not me to justify the wrong
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
  Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
  Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.


MMLXXXVI - "EPOSSESSETHALL"

  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  O, had they in that darksome prison died!
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Strange images of death. As thick as hail
  Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  To have me fold up Parca's fatal web?
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  Like captives bound to a triumphant car.


MMLXXXVII - "MINEEYEANDALLM"

  My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
  None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,
  Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!


MMLXXXVIII - "YSOULANDALLMYE"

  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
  O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
  Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
  Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMLXXXIX - "VERYPARTANDFOR"

  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
  And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
  For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
  Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.


MMXC - "THISSINTHEREIS"

  To entertain me as your steward still.
  Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
  I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
  So long as out of limit and true rule
  Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
  I send it through the rivers of your blood,
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
  His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  It had been so with us, had we been there.
  Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.


MMXCI - "NOREMEDYITISSO"

  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
  Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  More bright in zeal than the devotion which
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
  I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
  This shall assure my constant loyalty,
  If they return in their own shapes to woo?
  Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!


MMXCII - "GROUNDEDINWARD"

  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
  Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
  And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.


MMXCIII - "INMYHEARTMETHI"

  It would infect his speech, that if the king
  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
  The fraud of England, not the force of France,
  More bright in zeal than the devotion which
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
  He has borne all things well: and I do think
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.


MMXCIV - "NKSNOFACESOGRA"

  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  For thy solicitor shall rather die
  And yet, in substance and authority,
  Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.


MMXCV - "CIOUSISASMINEN"

  Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
  If broken, then it is no fault of mine.
  Or, if she be accused in true report,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  So do not you, for you are a light wench.
  I never saw an action of such shame;
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name;
  See, see the pining malady of France;
  Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!


MMXCVI - "OSHAPESOTRUENO"

  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  He hath a garden circummured with brick,
  As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
  Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  To tie the rider she begins to prove:
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  One drunkard loves another of the name.


MMXCVII - "TRUTHOFSUCHACC"

  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
  To take the basest and most poorest shape
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  Only be patient till we have appeased
  For thou art not so long by the head as
  She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
  Had the full view of, such a noise arose
  As I have such a heart that both mine ears
  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
  Come, side by side together live and die.


MMXCVIII - "OUNTANDFORMYSE"

  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
  This sound of hope doth labour to expel;
  And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Deal with poison; I will possess him with
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
  Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
  Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?


MMXCIX - "LFMINEOWNWORTH"

  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
  My love with words and errors still she feeds;
  I knit my handercher about your brows,
  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
  Now all is done, have what shall have no end:
  With courtesy and with respect enough;
  On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  This before all the world do I prefer;
  Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?


MMC - "DODEFINEASIALL"

  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
  If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
  Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Anon, as patient as the female dove
  Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
  In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
  And know how well I have deserved the ring,
  Let us not live in France; let us quit all
  Let's reason with the worst that may befall.


MMCI - "OTHERINALLWORT"

  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
  His foes are so enrooted with his friends
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
  Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
  Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  To link my dear friend to a common stale.


MMCII - "HSSURMOUNTBUTW"

  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
  Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
  Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
  Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
  The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
  By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  This head of safety; and withal to pry
  Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?


MMCIII - "HENMYGLASSSHOW"

  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
  You that will be less fearful than discreet,
  God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
  As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
  Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Stain'd with the variation of each soil
  His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.
  O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
  What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?


MMCIV - "SMEMYSELFINDEE"

  She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
  My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
  You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
  If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMCV - "DBEATEDANDCHOP"

  Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
  Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
  And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
  No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.


MMCVI - "PDWITHTANNDANT"

  Pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
  I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
  The goodly objects which abroad they find
  Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:
  That was not forced; that never was inclined
  And speaks not to himself but with a pride
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  Durst not presume to look once in the face.
  A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
  No might nor greatness in mortality
  That rage in savage sensuality.


MMCVII - "IQUITYMINEOWNS"

  I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
  Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  I know you all, and will awhile uphold
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Your honours shall perceive how I will work
  My lady's honour: what became of him
  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
  When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Some entertainment for them in their tents.


MMCVIII - "ELFLOVEQUITECO"

  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.
  Upon the very naked name of love.
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!


MMCIX - "NTRARYIREADSEL"

  Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  A Roman now adopted happily,
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
  I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.


MMCX - "FSOSELFLOVINGW"

  Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
  Set down, set down your honourable load,
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
  For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
  Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  I see you do not mean to part with her;
  No want of conscience hold it that I call
  Grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
  Was I a child to fear I know not what.


MMCXI - "EREINIQUITYTIS"

  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
  Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
  I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
  Question enrages him. At once, good night:
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  I know not what he shall. God send him well!
  The king and his companions: warily
  Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
  Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  I have no precious time at all to spend,
  Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.


MMCXII - "THEEMYSELFTHAT"

  There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
  He is complete in feature and in mind
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
  Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.


MMCXIII - "FORMYSELFIPRAI"

  For many lives stand between me and home:
  O good old man, how well in thee appears
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
  Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
  So is it not with me as with that Muse
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
  I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
  Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.


MMCXIV - "SEPAINTINGMYAG"

  Such commendations as becomes a maid,
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
  Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
  There's something in me that reproves my fault;
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
  Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
  Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
  And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


MMCXV - "EWITHBEAUTYOFT"

  Either of king or council, when you went
  Why would he for the momentary trick
  I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  And controversy hence a question takes,
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  The mariners say how thou hast disposed
  You stand upon the ravage and behold
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!


MMCXVI - "HYDAYSAGAINSTM"

  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
  Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
  A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  She could have run and waddled all about;
  And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;
  Going to find a bare-foot brother out
  As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
  I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
  That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
  Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.


MMCXVII - "YLOVESHALLBEAS"

  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  But now the mindful messenger, come back,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.


MMCXVIII - "IAMNOWWITHTIME"

  I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
  No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
  We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
  When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
  I am left out; for me nothing remains.
  That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
  Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


MMCXIX - "SINJURIOUSHAND"

  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  If you had sent but two hours before,--
  Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
  Joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
  One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  And now at length they overflow their banks.
  Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?


MMCXX - "CRUSHDANDOERWO"

  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
  O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?


MMCXXI - "RNWHENHOURSHAV"

  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  How shall we then dispense with that contract,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
  Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
  Have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
  Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.


MMCXXII - "EDRAINDHISBLOO"

  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
  I have no relish of them, but abound
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
  If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  But makes antiquity for aye his page,
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.


MMCXXIII - "DANDFILLDHISBR"

  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
  Not measuring what use we made of them.
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
  If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
  Like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
  Longer than I have time to tell his years!
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
  By all your vows of love and that great vow
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMCXXIV - "OWWITHLINESAND"

  Of disobedient opposition
  Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  It would not out at windows nor at doors.
  The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
  He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
  None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
  And better in my mind not undertook.
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Descended of so many royal kings.


MMCXXV - "WRINKLESWHENHI"

  What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  Into your idle over-handled theme:
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
  Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!


MMCXXVI - "SYOUTHFULMORNH"

  Save base authority from others' books
  You love the breeder better than the male.
  O, full of careful business are his looks!
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  He that has but effected his good will
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
  He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.


MMCXXVII - "ATHTRAVELLDONT"

  A pair so famous. High events as these
  Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
  Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?


MMCXXVIII - "OAGESSTEEPYNIG"

  Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
  Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  In fellest manner execute your aims.
  God-den to your worship, good Captain James.


MMCXXIX - "HTANDALLTHOSEB"

  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  The people know it; and have now received
  All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  And make a conquest of unhappy me,
  Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
  Labouring men; and therefore should we be
  To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
  He is already named, and gone to Scone
  Of what a monarchy you are the head:
  Since that the truest issue of thy throne
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.


MMCXXX - "EAUTIESWHEREOF"

  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  And with deep groans the diapason bear;
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
  If that your moody discontented souls
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!


MMCXXXI - "NOWHESKINGAREV"

  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  O, this will make my mother die with grief!
  Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
  How true a gentleman you send relief,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  No more than were I painted I would wish
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMCXXXII - "ANISHINGORVANI"

  A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
  Never so needful on the earth of France,
  I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
  Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  In golden palaces, as it becomes.
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
  None else of name; and of all other men
  I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.


MMCXXXIII - "SHDOUTOFSIGHTS"

  Send for your ring, I will return it home,
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
  Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
  Had graced the tender temples of my child,
  The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
  Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?


MMCXXXIV - "TEALINGAWAYTHE"

  Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  And my estate deserves an heir more raised
  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
  Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
  And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
  What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
  And, being intercepted in your sport,
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
  High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMCXXXV - "TREASUREOFHISS"

  To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
  Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
  Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
  Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms;
  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
  So shall you share all that he doth possess,
  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.


MMCXXXVI - "PRINGFORSUCHAT"

  Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Not he which says the dead is not alive.
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
  Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
  Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
  That he is too familiar with his wife.


MMCXXXVII - "IMEDOINOWFORTI"

  I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
  May reasonably die and never rise
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  If I could add a lie unto a fault,
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
  France friend with England, what becomes of me?
  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
  Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
  To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
  I stay but for my guidon: to the field!


MMCXXXVIII - "FYAGAINSTCONFO"

  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
  Your daughter and her cousin much commend
  And every one shall share i' the gains;
  Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
  Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
  I thank you for this profit; and from hence
  No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
  Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
  Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
  Never to part with it; and here he stands;
  For ever will I walk upon my knees,
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?


MMCXXXIX - "UNDINGAGESCRUE"

  Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
  Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
  No harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
  Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
  And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMCXL - "LKNIFETHATHESH"

  Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  I have a servant comes with me along,
  For we intend so to dispose you as
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  And let him say to England that we send
  The care I had and have of subjects' good
  He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.


MMCXLI - "ALLNEVERCUTFRO"

  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  Late did he shine upon the English side;
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.


MMCXLII - "MMEMORYMYSWEET"

  My face is full of shame, my heart of teen:
  Must I do so? and must I ravel out
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Much castigation, exercise devout;
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
  My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
  When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.


MMCXLIII - "LOVESBEAUTYTHO"

  Let me give light, but let me not be light;
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  To curb the will of the nobility:
  Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
  The napless vesture of humility;
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  O, they love least that let men know their love.


MMCXLIV - "UGHMYLOVERSLIF"

  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
  My favour were as great; be witness this.
  Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Retain but privilege of a private man?
  Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
  For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?


MMCXLV - "EHISBEAUTYSHAL"

  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
  Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.
  But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
  You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!


MMCXLVI - "LINTHESEBLACKL"

  Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
  Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
  Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
  Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.


MMCXLVII - "INESBESEENANDT"

  I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
  Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
  By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  So was I bid report here to the state
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
  A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
  Not changing heart with habit, I am still
  Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
  To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?


MMCXLVIII - "HEYSHALLLIVEAN"

  He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
  So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
  His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
  And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.


MMCXLIX - "DHEINTHEMSTILL"

  Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
  Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  I take my leave before I have begun,
  Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  He sent command to the lord mayor straight
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
  Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
  If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
  Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.


MMCL - "GREENWHENIHAVE"

  Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  And made an evening at the noontide prick.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMCLI - "SEENBYTIMESFEL"

  She did disdain my child, and stood between
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Forty days longer we do respite you;
  Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
  Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!


MMCLII - "LHANDDEFACEDTH"

  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
  And all the peers and nobles of the realm
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
  Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  For this they have been thoughtful to invest
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Did seem defensible. So you left him.
  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
  He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.


MMCLIII - "ERICHPROUDCOST"

  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
  Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Under the colour of commending him,
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
  The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.


MMCLIV - "OFOUTWORNBURIE"

  Of all mad matches, never was the like.
  Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  There is a lady in Verona here
  What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
  O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  But from this lady may proceed a gem
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  I must be patient till the heavens look
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMCLV - "DAGEWHENSOMETI"

  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  So soon was she along as he was down,
  Or who should study to prefer a peace.
  My father made in compassing the crown!
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,
  I will continue that I broach'd in jest.


MMCLVI - "MELOFTYTOWERSI"

  My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
  Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  Take in your love, and then let me alone.
  O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
  Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
  If she unmask her beauty to the moon.


MMCLVII - "SEEDOWNRAZEDAN"

  Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  And warrant limited unto my tongue.
  Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.


MMCLVIII - "DBRASSETERNALS"

  Depose him in the justice of his cause.
  By flatterers; and what they will inform,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Acquitted by a true substantial form,
  Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
  Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.


MMCLIX - "LAVETOMORTALRA"

  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
  And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  That set'st the word itself against the word!
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
  O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  And, from the place where you behold us now,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?


MMCLX - "GEWHENIHAVESEE"

  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  No danger in what show of death it makes,
  I do remember in this shepherd boy
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Sir, I did never win of you before.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMCLXI - "NTHEHUNGRYOCEA"

  Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
  They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
  Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  How easily murder is discovered!
  Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
  Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  You say you do not know the lady's mind:
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.


MMCLXII - "NGAINADVANTAGE"

  Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
  Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
  And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  And interchangeably set down their hands,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
  Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
  Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
  Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MMCLXIII - "ONTHEKINGDOMOF"

  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  To stay him from the fall of vanity:
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
  Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Out of the path which shall directly lead
  My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?


MMCLXIV - "THESHOREANDTHE"

  To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
  How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  He wears his honour in a box unseen,
  Of thy intents desires instruction,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Even for revenge mock my destruction!
  And interchanging blows I quickly shed
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMCLXV - "FIRMSOILWINOFT"

  For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
  I come by note, to give and to receive.
  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  May't please your majesty to give us leave
  Should many people, under two commands,
  O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
  If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
  I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
  For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
  That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.


MMCLXVI - "HEWATERYMAININ"

  Hath set the women on to this complaint:
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
  Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  Than when you left him; even now he sung.
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
  And six or seven winters more respect
  If this be error and upon me proved,
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
  Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.


MMCLXVII - "CREASINGSTOREW"

  CORIOLANUS!
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  And never see day that the happy sees,
  Shall the contents discover, something rare
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
  Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
  So to the laws at large I write my name:
  Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
  Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.


MMCLXVIII - "ITHLOSSANDLOSS"

  I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
  That in the dole of blows your son might drop.
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
  So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
  As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
  Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Let me in safety raise me from my knees
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Should not be able to encounter mine.
  Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!


MMCLXIX - "WITHSTOREWHENI"

  Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
  I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
  The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
  How can I then return in happy plight,
  Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
  Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
  In the remembrance of so fair a dream.


MMCLXX - "HAVESEENSUCHIN"

  Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now.
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
  Under a cloak that is of any length.
  Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.


MMCLXXI - "TERCHANGEOFSTA"

  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
  Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
  And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
  Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
  Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
  Found that the issue was not his begot;
  Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
  That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
  A million fail, confounding oath on oath.


MMCLXXII - "TEORSTATEITSEL"

  That they pass by me as the idle wind,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
  And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!


MMCLXXIII - "FCONFOUNDEDTOD"

  For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
  Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
  O, but I love his lady too too much,
  No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
  Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
  O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!


MMCLXXIV - "ECAYRUINHATHTA"

  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  And for amends to his posterity,
  You do it for increase: O strange excuse,
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
  And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
  That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
  How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
  Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.
  Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?


MMCLXXV - "UGHTMETHUSTORU"

  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
  He would embrace the means to come by it.
  Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
  May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  He is a sick man that would speak with you.
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  Though I am not bookish, yet I can read
  O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.


MMCLXXVI - "MINATETHATTIME"

  My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
  I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
  The bloody proclamation to escape
  Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
  I do pronounce him in that very shape
  My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MMCLXXVII - "WILLCOMEANDTAK"

  What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
  Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
  Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
  Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  That brings me food to make misfortune live?
  And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.


MMCLXXVIII - "EMYLOVEAWAYTHI"

  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
  Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
  Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
  Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
  That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
  Her father and her country and her friends,
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.


MMCLXXIX - "STHOUGHTISASAD"

  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
  That by degrees we mean to look into
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  Or what is now received: I witness to
  Under the colour of commending him,
  Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
  I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
  Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
  And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
  Sister, content you in my discontent.
  Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.


MMCLXXX - "EATHWHICHCANNO"

  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
  Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
  Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.
  Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  Carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
  Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Now fear I this will give it start again;
  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?


MMCLXXXI - "TCHOOSEBUTWEEP"

  Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
  Catching all passions in his craft of will:
  Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
  Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  But that I did proceed upon just grounds
  Upon his bad life to make all this good,
  This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
  With this, she falleth in the place she stood,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.


MMCLXXXII - "TOHAVETHATWHIC"

  There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
  O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
  According to the statute of the town,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Thy private feasting to a public fast,
  Has caught me in his eye: I will present
  And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
  The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
  Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
  Had the full view of, such a noise arose
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Come, is the bride ready to go to church?


MMCLXXXIII - "HITFEARSTOLOSE"

  Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
  I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
  That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
  For on his visage was in little drawn
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  That those which fly before the battle ends
  O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
  Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
  So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
  Either of you to be the other's end.


MMCLXXXIV - "SINCEBRASSNORS"

  So is my love still telling what is told.
  In me at once: but to the brightest beams
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.
  Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
  Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Say how he died, for I will hear it all.


MMCLXXXV - "TONENOREARTHNO"

  This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
  Of all be hated, but the most of me!
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  No, my good lord; I met him back again.
  Of thy intents desires instruction,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Even for revenge mock my destruction!
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.


MMCLXXXVI - "RBOUNDLESSSEAB"

  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
  On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
  Do I put up that womanly defence,
  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
  Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
  Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
  Before the king will grant her humble suit.


MMCLXXXVII - "UTSADMORTALITY"

  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
  Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
  Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
  Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Take but degree away, untune that string,
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
  In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
  Thy letters have transported me beyond
  Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.


MMCLXXXVIII - "OERSWAYSTHEIRP"

  One way or other, she is for a king;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
  When creeping murmur and the poring dark
  Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  To make some special instant special blest,
  He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.


MMCLXXXIX - "OWERHOWWITHTHI"

  Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
  Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
  If you deny me, fie upon your law!
  The treasury of everlasting joy.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
  He hath refused it in the open court:
  If Warwick be so near as men report.


MMCXC - "SRAGESHALLBEAU"

  Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
  Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  But where's the body that I should embrace?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
  Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.


MMCXCI - "TYHOLDAPLEAWHO"

  That rage in savage sensuality.
  Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
  Here on my knee I beg mortality,
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
  And I again, in Henry's royal name,
  Patience is scottish, and impatience does
  Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.


MMCXCII - "SEACTIONISNOST"

  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
  To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
  If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
  O, let me teach you how to knit again
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  I play the noble housewife with the time
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.


MMCXCIII - "RONGERTHANAFLO"

  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
  Never came poison from so sweet a place.
  Go with me; if you like upon report
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
  He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
  And therefore level not to hit their lives.
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.


MMCXCIV - "WEROHOWSHALLSU"

  Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
  O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
  Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?


MMCXCV - "MMERSHONEYBREA"

  My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
  My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
  How might a prince of my great hopes forget
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.


MMCXCVI - "THHOLDOUTAGAIN"

  To the ambassadors of England gives
  How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
  O God! that one might read the book of fate,
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  That we must curb it upon others' proof;
  And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
  And tread it under foot with all contempt,
  I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
  None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!


MMCXCVII - "STTHEWRECKFULS"

  Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
  The clothiers all, not able to maintain
  The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
  He had a fever when he was in Spain,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Come from the north; and as I came along
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
  Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Still live they and for ever may they last!


MMCXCVIII - "IEGEOFBATTERIN"

  Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  For God doth know how many now in health
  By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
  A merchant of incomparable wealth.
  The day, my friends and all things stay for me.
  That had a heart to love, and in that heart
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Is all the policy, strength and defence,
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.


MMCXCIX - "GDAYSWHENROCKS"

  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
  You have but jested with me all this while.
  Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
  Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
  So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.


MMCC - "IMPREGNABLEARE"

  I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
  Make war against proportion'd course of time;
  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  And let the angel whom thou still hast served
  Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


MMCCI - "NOTSOSTOUTNORG"

  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
  This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
  Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
  Of our restored love and amity.
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  God knows I will not do it, to the death.


MMCCII - "ATESOFSTEELSOS"

  Away, away, good William de la Pole!
  Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Study me how to please the eye indeed
  O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
  From any private malice in his end,
  So is my love still telling what is told.
  To be set high in place, we did commend
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
  So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
  On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.


MMCCIII - "TRONGBUTTIMEDE"

  Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
  Great king, within this coffin I present
  Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
  To be so tickled, they would change their state
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  Must have their voices; neither will they bate
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMCCIV - "CAYSOFEARFULME"

  Can any face of brass hold longer out?
  And dress'd myself in such humility
  You heavy people, circle me about,
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
  Myself have often heard him say and swear
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMCCV - "DITATIONWHEREA"

  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
  Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
  Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.


MMCCVI - "LACKSHALLTIMES"

  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
  Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
  Led hither by pure love: which of them both
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
  If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
  Must have inventions to delight the taste,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.


MMCCVII - "BESTJEWELFROMT"

  Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  When yond same star that's westward from the pole
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  From whence with life he never more sprung up.
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.


MMCCVIII - "IMESCHESTLIEHI"

  It were not for your quiet nor your good,
  Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.


MMCCIX - "DORWHATSTRONGH"

  Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Return again, and take an oath with thee.
  Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
  Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
  And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
  To send in to your wife: my suit to her
  Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
  To build at all? Much more, in this great work--
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?


MMCCX - "ANDCANHOLDHISS"

  Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel
  No settled senses of the world can match
  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  As, sick and blunted with community,
  Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
  How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
  O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
  Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  He sent command to the lord mayor straight
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.


MMCCXI - "WIFTFOOTBACKOR"

  Will I with wine and wassail so convince
  Is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
  First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
  This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
  For he that steeps his safety in true blood
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
  But as this title honours me and mine,
  And let my counsel sway you in this case.
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  One god is god of both, as poets feign;
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MMCCXII - "WHOHISSPOILOFB"

  What think you? may we, with the warrant of
  How have you made division of yourself?
  O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
  How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
  I never heard a passion so confused,
  So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
  Should of another therefore be abused!
  Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
  O my dear father, restoration hang
  In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
  O, then began the tempest to my soul,
  For princes are the glass, the school, the book,
  Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.


MMCCXIII - "EAUTYCANFORBID"

  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask
  Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
  The better that your lordship please to ask.
  You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
  Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
  And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
  Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
  I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?


MMCCXIV - "ONONEUNLESSTHI"

  Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  Or else he never would compare between.
  No settled senses of the world can match
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
  In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!


MMCCXV - "SMIRACLEHAVEMI"

  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
  Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
  If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
  Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
  Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
  And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  My head with more ill news, for it is full.
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.


MMCCXVI - "GHTTHATINBLACK"

  Garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
  That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  And when you are desirous to be blest,
  To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
  In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
  Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
  Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
  Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!


MMCCXVII - "INKMYLOVEMAYST"

  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
  Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
  Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
  Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.


MMCCXVIII - "ILLSHINEBRIGHT"

  I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
  Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.


MMCCXIX - "TIREDWITHALLTH"

  Thought characters and words merely but art,
  If half thy outward graces had been placed
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  With full as many signs of deadly hate,
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  And that is false thou dost report to us.
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.


MMCCXX - "ESEFORRESTFULD"

  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!
  One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  So far from variation or quick change?
  To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
  For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Let him alone, for I remember now
  Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!


MMCCXXI - "EATHICRYASTOBE"

  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
  That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
  He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
  CORIOLANUS,
  Receive the sentence of the law for sins
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  A salve for any sore that may betide.
  Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
  Then further, all dissembling set aside,
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  By staying there so long till all were lost.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMCCXXII - "HOLDDESERTABEG"

  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
  And so success of mischief shall be born,
  But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  God keep me from false friends! but they were none.


MMCCXXIII - "GARBORNANDNEED"

  God knows I had as lief be none as one.
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Receive the sentence of the law for sins
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
  No settled senses of the world can match
  Did this companion with the saffron face
  No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.


MMCCXXIV - "YNOTHINGTRIMMD"

  Your honours shall perceive how I will work
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
  His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
  It would amaze the proudest of you all.
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
  Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
  More than his singularity, he goes
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.


MMCCXXV - "INJOLLITYANDPU"

  I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
  Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
  Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
  Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
  It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
  Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Point-devise companions; such rackers of
  Upon the very naked name of love.


MMCCXXVI - "RESTFAITHUNHAP"

  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Something to do with you. Come, you're a young
  To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
  Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
  And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
  I guess one angel in another's hell:
  That's able to breathe life into a stone,
  Higher, or return again into France?
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
  Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.


MMCCXXVII - "PILYFORSWORNAN"

  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  It shall do well. But yet do I believe
  Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:
  You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
  Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
  O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
  When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
  On late offenders, that he now doth lack
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  All which we pine for now: and this report
  Not having that, which, having, makes them short.


MMCCXXVIII - "DGUILDEDHONOUR"

  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
  Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  Under the moon, can save the thing from death
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  Lysander and myself will fly this place.
  Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
  Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
  O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
  Upon the love and truth and vows which I
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.


MMCCXXIX - "SHAMEFULLYMISP"

  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
  And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
  Married to your good service, stay till death:
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
  Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
  Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
  Men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
  I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
  Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
  Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.


MMCCXXX - "LACEDANDMAIDEN"

  Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:
  As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
  Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
  As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,
  And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
  I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.


MMCCXXXI - "VIRTUERUDELYST"

  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I shall; and bring his answer presently.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
  Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
  That know the strong'st and surest way to get.


MMCCXXXII - "RUMPETEDANDRIG"

  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Past all expressing. It is very meet
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  The ringleader and head of all this rout,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
  As if the dead the living should exceed;
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  I will take order for her keeping close.
  Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.


MMCCXXXIII - "HTPERFECTIONWR"

  How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
  That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,
  Perforce will force it overflow the bank.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  For we intend so to dispose you as
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  To my keen curses; for without my wrong
  Is death to any he that utters them.
  O master, master I have watch'd so long
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Will fashion the event in better shape
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.


MMCCXXXIV - "ONGFULLYDISGRA"

  On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
  No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
  Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
  If ever man were moved with woman moans,
  Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  And never mount to trouble you again.


MMCCXXXV - "CEDANDSTRENGTH"

  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Some nobler token I have kept apart
  The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Not any, but abide the change of time,
  Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
  Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.


MMCCXXXVI - "BYLIMPINGSWAYD"

  Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,
  Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
  Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
  Which else would put you to your fortune and
  Are visibly character'd and engraved,
  Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.


MMCCXXXVII - "ISABLEDANDARTM"

  Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  And military title capital
  Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
  As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
  More than he haply may retail from me.


MMCCXXXVIII - "ADETONGUETIEDB"

  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!


MMCCXXXIX - "YAUTHORITYANDF"

  You will compel me, then, to read the will?
  And let me find a charter in your voice,
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
  There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
  Your potent and infectious fevers heap
  And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  For me, most wretched, to perform the like.


MMCCXL - "OLLYDOCTORLIKE"

  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
  You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Commanded always by the greater gust;
  The duke cannot deny the course of law:
  Of dire combustion and confused events
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMCCXLI - "CONTROLLINGSKI"

  Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
  Or else he must not only die the death,
  Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
  That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  No, my good lord, he is in presence here.
  Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
  Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
  Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
  I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.


MMCCXLII - "LLANDSIMPLETRU"

  Let me be blest to make this happy close;
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
  Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
  I would not my unhoused free condition
  My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  Uncertain of the issue any way.


MMCCXLIII - "THMISCALLDSIMP"

  That his attendant--so his case was like,
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
  Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  And then end life when I end loyalty!
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Led hither by pure love: which of them both
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
  If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.


MMCCXLIV - "LICITYANDCAPTI"

  Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
  I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
  Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
  Your honours shall perceive how I will work
  And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
  Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
  And were I not immortal, life were done
  Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
  That which my daughter came to look upon,
  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.


MMCCXLV - "VEGOODATTENDIN"

  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
  The dominations, royalties and rights
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.


MMCCXLVI - "GCAPTAINILLTIR"

  Good mother, be content; it is no more
  Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
  And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  It is not good to cross him; give him way.
  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.


MMCCXLVII - "EDWITHALLTHESE"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  Why speaks my father so ungently? This
  I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
  Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
  He never would have stay'd in France so long.
  And when the morning sun shall raise his car
  Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMCCXLVIII - "FROMTHESEWOULD"

  Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
  That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?


MMCCXLIX - "IBEGONESAVETHA"

  In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
  But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
  Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Seeing such emulation in their woe,
  And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  To keep in darkness what occasion now
  Hover about me with your airy wings
  And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!


MMCCL - "TTODIEILEAVEMY"

  Then think you right: I am not what I am.
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
  I am so far already in your gifts,--
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
  Let it be so: I do commit his youth
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Although I swear it to myself alone.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.


MMCCLI - "LOVEALONEAHWHE"

  Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
  Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
  Or by the father there were none at all;
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
  Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
  Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
  How can I then return in happy plight,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMCCLII - "REFOREWITHINFE"

  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Recall not what we give, and therein may
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
  If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
  Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
  For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMCCLIII - "CTIONSHOULDHEL"

  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
  I that do bring the news made not the match.
  O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
  Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,
  Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
  He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.


MMCCLIV - "IVEANDWITHHISP"

  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
  No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
  Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
  I shall be reconciled to him again.
  To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Hearing applause and universal shout,
  I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
  Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
  Presented to the tears of soft remorse.


MMCCLV - "RESENCEGRACEIM"

  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
  Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  In the remembrance of a weeping queen.
  My Oberon! what visions have I seen!


MMCCLVI - "PIETYTHATSINBY"

  Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
  Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  The dearer by I know how much an ounce.
  Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
  To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
  Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:
  And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
  Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
  You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.


MMCCLVII - "HIMADVANTAGESH"

  How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
  It were not good; for therein should we read
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  As if the golden fee for which I plead
  Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  To seek him here that means not to be found.
  And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.
  How now, my lords! what, all unready so?


MMCCLVIII - "OULDACHIEVEAND"

  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
  Did give him that same royalty he wears;
  And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  His royal self in judgment comes to hear
  If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  And would have kept so long as breath did last!
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.


MMCCLIX - "LACEITSELFWITH"

  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  And pray that I may repossess the crown.
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
  To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:
  For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
  Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
  Into the channel, till the lowest stream
  They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
  He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.


MMCCLX - "HISSOCIETYWHYS"

  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  Is more vindicative than jealous love:
  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
  I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
  Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  You come to take your stand here, and behold
  Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?


MMCCLXI - "HOULDFALSEPAIN"

  Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
  Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
  For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
  And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
  Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
  Should hold up high in brass, and such again
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
  An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
  In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MMCCLXII - "TINGIMITATEHIS"

  The story that is printed in her blood?
  If it conceived a male child by me, should
  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
  If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
  I'll yield myself to prison willingly,
  The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
  Still live they and for ever may they last!


MMCCLXIII - "CHEEKANDSTEALD"

  Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
  He see me, you shall see him nod at me.
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
  And with advantage means to pay thy love:
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
  Do you set down your name in the scroll of
  So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;
  That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  Dare no man answer in a case of truth?


MMCCLXIV - "EADSEEINGOFHIS"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  Son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Give me some ink and paper in my tent
  Out of the path which shall directly lead
  From whence you spring by lineal descent.
  How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
  I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.


MMCCLXV - "LIVINGHUEWHYSH"

  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  Good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
  He might have took his answer long ago.
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
  His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.


MMCCLXVI - "OULDPOORBEAUTY"

  O, is that all? What will you give me now
  Undoing all, as all had never been!
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
  Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
  Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  To find the mind's construction in the face:
  You wronged yourself to write in such a case.


MMCCLXVII - "INDIRECTLYSEEK"

  If you will lead these graces to the grave
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?


MMCCLXVIII - "ROSESOFSHADOWS"

  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Or, if I live, is it not very like,
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  From thence to England; where I hope ere long
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
  And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Or wallow naked in December snow
  Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
  Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.


MMCCLXIX - "INCEHISROSEIST"

  I would the state of time had first been whole
  Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
  Child of integrity, hath from my soul
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  He was not taken well; he had not dined:
  I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
  She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Other men fitter to go out than I.
  Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Into the law of children. Be not fond,
  Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
  The splinter of a lance. Even so much.


MMCCLXX - "RUEWHYSHOULDHE"

  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
  Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
  Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  How white and red each other did destroy!
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
  Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
  Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.


MMCCLXXI - "LIVENOWNATUREB"

  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.


MMCCLXXII - "ANKRUPTISBEGGA"

  All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
  No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
  Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
  Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
  If you do free your children from the sword,
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
  Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
  And more such days as these to us befall!


MMCCLXXIII - "RDOFBLOODTOBLU"

  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Do shameful execution on herself.
  Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
  For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
  Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
  O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  The bloody proclamation to escape
  Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
  But I would have the soil of her fair rape
  Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
  Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.


MMCCLXXIV - "SHTHROUGHLIVEL"

  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,
  The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  O noble prince, I can discover all
  Upon the head of this forgetful man
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!


MMCCLXXV - "YVEINSFORSHEHA"

  Your daughter and her cousin much commend
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  I must confess that I have heard so much,
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
  For you must know, we have with special soul
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
  He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  And who can sever love from charity?


MMCCLXXVI - "THNOEXCHEQUERN"

  Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
 eXcept to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
  Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Retaining but a quantity of life,
  Nothing in France, until he have no wife!


MMCCLXXVII - "OWBUTHISANDPRO"

  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  When time is broke and no proportion kept!
  Be thou my witness that against my will,
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
  Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
  And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
  Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Plant those that have revolted in the van,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!


MMCCLXXVIII - "UDOFMANYLIVESU"

  Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  Of love between your daughter and himself;
  For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
  My mate, that's never to be found again,
  And for his sake wear the detested blot
  No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
  Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
  Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!


MMCCLXXIX - "PONHISGAINSOHI"

  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
  Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
  As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
  I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.


MMCCLXXX - "MSHESTORESTOSH"

  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  See you these clothes? say you see them not and
  To give admittance to a thought of fear.
  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
  He lives that loves thee better than he could.


MMCCLXXXI - "OWWHATWEALTHSH"

  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  Whither away, or where is thy abode?
  Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
  Though their injunction be to bar my doors
  When we were happy we had other names.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.


MMCCLXXXII - "EHADINDAYSLONG"

  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  In your behalf still will I wear the same.
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!


MMCCLXXXIII - "SINCEBEFORETHE"

  Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
  In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Birth-day; and there are princes and knights come
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  For such disguise as haply shall become
  O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  There's other work in hand: I see a thing
  Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMCCLXXXIV - "SELASTSOBADTHU"

  Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
  As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
  Seeming to bury that posterity
  Ten years are spent since first he undertook
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
  As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
  Under whose government come they along?


MMCCLXXXV - "SISHISCHEEKTHE"

  So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  I am so lated in the world, that I
  Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
  I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains
  Study to break it and not break my troth.
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
  The death of all, and all together lost.
  Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMCCLXXXVI - "MAPOFDAYSOUTWO"

  Must be provided for: and you shall put
  As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.
  Praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
  Our business valued, some twelve days hence
  For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
  Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
  And whirl along with thee about the globe.
  You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
  Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MMCCLXXXVII - "RNWHENBEAUTYLI"

  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
  Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Not knowing them until we know their grave:
  Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
  Let his deservings and my love withal
  I am not well in health, and that is all.


MMCCLXXXVIII - "VEDANDDIEDASFL"

  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Do in his name religiously demand
  And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
  Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Do not abuse my master's bounty by
  And free my country from calamity:
  She showed him favors to allure his eye;
  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.


MMCCLXXXIX - "OWERSDONOWBEFO"

  Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
  Which presently they read; on whose contents,
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  So honour cross it from the north to south,
  During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
  O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
  Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
  But gladly would be better satisfied
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  From open haunts and popularity.
  Of his self-love, to stop posterity?


MMCCXC - "RETHEBASTARDSI"

  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To bring him to the haven; left these notes
  He fell upon me ere admitted: then
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Besides, he says there are two councils held;
  All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.


MMCCXCI - "GNSOFFAIRWEREB"

  Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
  Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  O you immortal gods! I will not go.
  Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
  For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
  And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Be valiant and give signal to the fight.


MMCCXCII - "ORNORDURSTINHA"

  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
  Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
  Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
  And so in this, to bear me down with braves.


MMCCXCIII - "BITONALIVINGBR"

  Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
  I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
  This weighty business will not brook delay:
  Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  And am most sensibly in grief for it,
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
  Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
  Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
  Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


MMCCXCIV - "OWBEFORETHEGOL"

  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
  By all the vows that ever men have broke,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  From me far off, with others all too near.
  O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep
  Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
  Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.


MMCCXCV - "DENTRESSESOFTH"

  Do the part of an honest man in it.
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
  Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
  For wise men say it is the wisest course.
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?


MMCCXCVI - "EDEADTHERIGHTO"

  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  And for my sister and her princely sons,
  Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
  This man is better than the man he slew,
  Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  I have from their confines call'd to enact
  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.


MMCCXCVII - "FSEPULCHRESWER"

  For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
  So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
  Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
  He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
  Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MMCCXCVIII - "ESHORNAWAYTOLI"

  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
  Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
  Only for praise: and praise we may afford
  Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
  When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like
  And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.


MMCCXCIX - "VEASECONDLIFEO"

  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
  On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  I could have well diverted her intents,
  For hither we have broken in by force.
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Observe his inclination in yourself.


MMCCC - "NSECONDHEADERE"

  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  Haply I see a friend will save my life
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MMCCCI - "BEAUTYSDEADFLE"

  Before that England give the French the foil.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
  Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
  So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
  Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  For the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
  Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.


MMCCCII - "ECEMADEANOTHER"

  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
  And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
  Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  And have my learning from some true reports,
  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.


MMCCCIII - "GAYINHIMTHOSEH"

  Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
  As was your former; but she shall be such
  You heavy people, circle me about,
  Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
  More French: I shall never move thee in French,
  That never saw the giant world enraged;
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?


MMCCCIV - "OLYANTIQUEHOUR"

  Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
  Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
  Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
  This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
  Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
  Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
  O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


MMCCCV - "SARESEENWITHOU"

  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  And with submissive loyalty of heart
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd wound.
  In doing courtesies, and one in whom
  To whom I am so infinitely bound.
  Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?


MMCCCVI - "TALLORNAMENTIT"

  Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
  Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
  Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
  Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
  To be oppos'd against the warring winds?


MMCCCVII - "SELFANDTRUEMAK"

  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
  For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
  And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
  No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
  And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
  Know I these men that come along with you?


MMCCCVIII - "INGNOSUMMEROFA"

  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
  Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
  A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.


MMCCCIX - "NOTHERSGREENRO"

  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Or whether that the body public be
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?


MMCCCX - "BBINGNOOLDTODR"

  Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
  But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
  It made me laugh to see the villain run.
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
  O, let me in my present wildness die,
  Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
  Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!


MMCCCXI - "ESSHISBEAUTYNE"

  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
  Speak England first, that hath been forward first
  Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
  I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  To eke it and to draw it out in length,
  You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMCCCXII - "WANDHIMASFORAM"

  Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
  And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
  Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
  It is to you, good people, that I speak,
  My evils conjured to remembrance and
  As though she bid me stay by her a week;
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
  O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
  My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!


MMCCCXIII - "APDOTHNATUREST"

  As now they are, and making practised smiles,
  Patience is scottish, and impatience does
  Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
  Until thy head be circled with the same.
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.


MMCCCXIV - "ORETOSHOWFALSE"

  O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
  Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
  See what a grace was seated on this brow;
  Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
  O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
  Will bear up with this exercise, so long
  For nature puts me to a heavy task:
  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MMCCCXV - "ARTWHATBEAUTYW"

  As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  These are complements, these are humours; these
  When he to madding Dido would unfold
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
  But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
  Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
  Yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.


MMCCCXVI - "ASOFYORETHOSEP"

  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
  Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
  For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
  Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
  She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.


MMCCCXVII - "ARTSOFTHEETHAT"

  As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
  So tender over his occasions, true,
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
  That will be thaw'd from the true quality
  His folly to the mettle of my speech?
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
  Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
  And your three motives to the battle, with
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.


MMCCCXVIII - "THEWORLDSEYEDO"

  Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
  Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
  Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
  Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.


MMCCCXIX - "THVIEWWANTNOTH"

  That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
  How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  I am a feather for each wind that blows:
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
  What maintenance he from his friends receives,
  And come ye now to tell me John hath made
  Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  The noble duke hath been too much abused.
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
  How came the noble Timon to this change?


MMCCCXX - "INGTHATTHETHOU"

  It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
  To be of such a weak and silly mind
  Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
  And controversy hence a question takes,
  Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
  The very soul, and sweet religion makes
  How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
  Having been well, that would have made me sick,
  Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.


MMCCCXXI - "GHTOFHEARTSCAN"

  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Her best is better'd with a more delight.
  Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
  O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
  False to his children or his wife's allies
  Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  All's not offence that indiscretion finds
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
  Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
  Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
  As great in admiration as herself;
  Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.


MMCCCXXII - "MENDALLTONGUES"

  Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
  That I am guiltless of your father's death,
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.


MMCCCXXIII - "THEVOICEOFSOUL"

  That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
  In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
  Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
  Should many people, under two commands,
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
  Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.


MMCCCXXIV - "SGIVETHEETHATD"

  So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
  Going to chapel; and the voice is now
  I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Thus much the business is: we have here writ
  Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
  He hath a person and a smooth dispose
  And made an evening at the noontide prick.
  To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?


MMCCCXXV - "UEUTTERINGBARE"

  Under the service of a child as soon
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  That shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
  Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Is't possible you will away to-night?
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
  Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
  And towards London they do bend their course,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMCCCXXVI - "TRUTHEVENSOASF"

  The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  This Plot of death when sadly she had laid,
  He says they can do nothing in this kind.
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  So long as out of limit and true rule
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  As I do live by food, I met a fool,
  So much against the mettle of your sex,
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.


MMCCCXXVII - "OESCOMMENDTHYO"

  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
  Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
  My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
  Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
  To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  York set him on to fight and die in shame,
  Or whether revolution be the same.


MMCCCXXVIII - "UTWARDTHUSWITH"

  Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
  That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  Would that alone, alone he would detain,
  As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
  So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
  Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,
  I heard no letter from my master since
  That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
  Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!


MMCCCXXIX - "OUTWARDPRAISEI"

  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  That I, unworthy body as I am,
  What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
  Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
  In the most terrible and nimble stroke
  Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  It is no sin at all, but charity.


MMCCCXXX - "SCROWNDBUTTHOS"

  She bade good night that kept my rest away;
  Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
  Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,
  Now sit we close about this taper here,
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
  To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
  His father never was so true begot:
  One drunkard loves another of the name.
  Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!


MMCCCXXXI - "ESAMETONGUESTH"

  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
  And posts, like the commandment of a king,
  My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
  Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
  Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
  Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
  Usurps the regal title and the seat
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
  The more degenerate and base art thou,
  How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?


MMCCCXXXII - "ATGIVETHEESOTH"

  A lullaby too rough: I never saw
  The extreme parts of time extremely forms
  Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
  Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  So are they all, all honourable men--
  Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
  Turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
  Hath been between this lady and this lord.


MMCCCXXXIII - "INEOWNINOTHERA"

  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  I would the state of time had first been whole
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.


MMCCCXXXIV - "CCENTSDOTHISPR"

  Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;
  Could make me any summer's story tell,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
  Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
  Of fourteen; I have known thee already.
  Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
  Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
  Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
  Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
  Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.


MMCCCXXXV - "AISECONFOUNDBY"

  As the unsullied lily, I protest,
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  So many hours must I take my rest;
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
  O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
  O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.
  Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
  But we will presently provide for them.
  You see how simple and how fond I am.


MMCCCXXXVI - "SEEINGFARTHERT"

  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
  First, in this forest let us do those ends
  And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  The king hath many marching in his coats.


MMCCCXXXVII - "HANTHEEYEHATHS"

  How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
  As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
  He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
  And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Hath to the marbled mansion all above
  Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.


MMCCCXXXVIII - "HOWNTHEYLOOKIN"

  He asks of you, that never used to beg.
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  I have provided for you: stay awhile,
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?


MMCCCXXXIX - "TOTHEBEAUTYOFT"

  To sue his livery and beg his peace,
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
  Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
  The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  For the instalment of this noble duke
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.


MMCCCXL - "HYMINDANDTHATI"

  Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
  Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
  And much too little of that good I saw
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  Her face the book of praises, where is read
  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  That holds his honour higher than his ease,
  I cannot be much lower than my knees.


MMCCCXLI - "NGUESSTHEYMEAS"

  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Sentenced and stay upon execution.
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  The dauntless spirit of resolution.
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
  Say but the word, and I will be his priest.


MMCCCXLII - "UREBYTHYDEEDST"

  Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
  Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
  That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
  That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?


MMCCCXLIII - "HENCHURLSTHEIR"

  His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
  How fain would I have hated all mankind!
  Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  The light will show, character'd in my brow,
  Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  If they not thought the profits of my death
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MMCCCXLIV - "THOUGHTSALTHOU"

  The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
  Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
  God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  This I do vow and this shall ever be;
  Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  And therefore is Love said to be a child,
  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.


MMCCCXLV - "GHTHEIREYESWER"

  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  He shall here find his friends with horse and men
  They basely fly and dare not stay the field.
  He gave his nose and took't away again;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
  Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMCCCXLVI - "EKINDTOTHYFAIR"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
  Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
  Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
  That proof is call'd impossibility.
  Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
  The napless vesture of humility;
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  Your gracious self to take on you the charge
  For thou art not so long by the head as
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!


MMCCCXLVII - "FLOWERADDTHERA"

  For what they have not, that which they possess
  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  O Antony, beg not your death of us.
  Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
  He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.


MMCCCXLVIII - "NKSMELLOFWEEDS"

  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
  Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,
  My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his
  Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
  Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.


MMCCCXLIX - "BUTWHYTHYODOUR"

  Break with your wives of your departure hence:
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  That palter with us in a double sense;
  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
  His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
  You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
  Of the all-building law; and that there were
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  Upon that day either prepare to die
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.


MMCCCL - "MATCHETHNOTTHY"

  Master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--
  As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
  Here are your sons again; and I must lose
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  The dedicated words which writers use
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
  Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
  You call love to be a sect or scion.


MMCCCLI - "SHOWTHESOLVEIS"

  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
  There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
  Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?
  So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.


MMCCCLII - "THISTHATTHOUDO"

  Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
  I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  And this may help to thicken other proofs
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
  Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
  Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
  Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!


MMCCCLIII - "STCOMMONGROWTH"

  She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
  The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
  Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  My Lord of York, it better show'd with you
  O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
  Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
  Within this limit is relief enough,
  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  Have you importuned him by any means?


MMCCCLIV - "ATTHOUARTBLAME"

  A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
  There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
  O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
  Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
  Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
  But that's no argument for kissing now;
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  And when she put it on, she made me vow
  Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


MMCCCLV - "DSHALLNOTBETHY"

  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Shall I forget myself to be myself?
  Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;
  Affliction till it do cry out itself
  Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  The childing autumn, angry winter, change
  Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
  You shall know all that you are like to know.


MMCCCLVI - "DEFECTFORSLAND"

  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
  This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
  For as I am, I live upon the rack.
  Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Dear amity and everlasting love.


MMCCCLVII - "ERSMARKWASEVER"

  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
  My lord and master loves you: O, such love
  And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
  Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
  And with his knee the door he opens wide.
  Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MMCCCLVIII - "YETTHEFAIRTHEO"

  You never shall, so help you truth and God!
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
  Have after-nourishment and life by care;
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  For ere thou canst report I will be there,
  And then away to Venice to your friend;
  In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  The precious jewel of thy home return.
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!


MMCCCLIX - "RNAMENTOFBEAUT"

  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  That promise noble service: and they come
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
  But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  A lullaby too rough: I never saw
  Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
  That this fair action may on foot be brought.


MMCCCLX - "YISSUSPECTACRO"

  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
  Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
  Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
  Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?


MMCCCLXI - "WTHATFLIESINHE"

  Without the beauty of a woman's face?
  Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
  Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
  And so I was; which plainly signified
  To half a soul and to a notion crazed
  For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
  Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
  If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMCCCLXII - "AVENSSWEETESTA"

  Art not without ambition, but without
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
  Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  She did disdain my child, and stood between
  Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.


MMCCCLXIII - "IRSOTHOUBEGOOD"

  It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  She's such a one, that, were I well assured
  Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
  Of marching to Philippi presently?
  Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
  But not to tell of good or evil luck,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.


MMCCCLXIV - "SLANDERDOTHBUT"

  So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
  Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
  Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
  Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
  Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  O, this will make my mother die with grief!
  The one as famous for a scolding tongue
  Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
  Believe so much in him, that he is young,
  Upon the country where you make abode;
  That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!


MMCCCLXV - "APPROVETHYWORT"

  As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
  Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
  Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  That damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
  When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.


MMCCCLXVI - "HTHEGREATERBEI"

  His deeds with doing them, and is content
  The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
  His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.


MMCCCLXVII - "NGWOODOFTIMEFO"

  No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
  We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
  The interruption of their churlish drums
  Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
  Man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
  Or else he never would compare between.


MMCCCLXVIII - "RCANKERVICETHE"

  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
  Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  To melt the city leads upon your pates,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.


MMCCCLXIX - "SWEETESTBUDSDO"

  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  With a paper: God give him grace to groan!
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
  Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
  Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
  Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
  Of greater time than I shall show to be.


MMCCCLXX - "THLOVEANDTHOUP"

  They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  Look forward on the journey you shall go.
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
  No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
  How shall I honour thee for this success?
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
  Please you draw near. Louder the music there!


MMCCCLXXI - "RESENTSTAPUREU"

  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  No certain life achieved by others' death.
  To match with her that brings no vantages.
  Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
  To cull the plots of best advantages:
  And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
  Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Upon my blessing, I command thee go.


MMCCCLXXII - "NSTAINEDPRIMET"

  Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
  Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
  To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
  A very fatal place it seems to me.
  I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
  My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  That two such noble peers as ye should jar!


MMCCCLXXIII - "HOUHASTPASSDBY"

  He prays but faintly and would be denied;
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  Unto the legions on the other side.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
  An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
  Some entertainment for them in their tents.
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
  By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.


MMCCCLXXIV - "THEAMBUSHOFYOU"

  To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
  My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
  But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
  Her times of preservation, which perforce
  O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
  For hither we have broken in by force.
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?


MMCCCLXXV - "NGDAYSEITHERNO"

  Nay, he must bear you company. The king
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
  You conjure from the breast of civil peace
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  He hath but as offended in a dream!
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Or nature makes me suddenly relent.


MMCCCLXXVI - "TASSAILDORVICT"

  The pretty follies that themselves commit;
  All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
  So that but one heart we can make of it;
  So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
  And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
  Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.


MMCCCLXXVII - "ORBEINGCHARGED"

  O noble prince, I can discover all
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  I thought upon one pair of English legs
  No new device to beat this from his brains?
  Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
  Reward did threaten and encourage him,
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
  Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.


MMCCCLXXVIII - "YETTHISTHYPRAI"

  Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
  Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
  Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out
  Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
  That as a waist doth girdle you about,
  How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.
  Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
  And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?


MMCCCLXXIX - "SECANNOTBESOTH"

  Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
  As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  By something showing a more swelling port
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.


MMCCCLXXX - "YPRAISETOTIEUP"

  Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
  Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
  I know not where is that Promethean heat
  Some officers take them away. Good guard
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  The king is full of grace and fair regard.
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
  I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Upon the heavy middle of the night
  Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.


MMCCCLXXXI - "ENVYEVERMOREEN"

  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Not better than he, by her own report.


MMCCCLXXXII - "LARGEDIFSOMESU"

  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
  And thence retire me to my Milan, where
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Give me some sack; and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
  Stay but a little, I will come again.
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Must not be measured by his worth, for then
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
  Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.


MMCCCLXXXIII - "SPECTOFILLMASK"

  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
  Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
  Of this most fair occasion, by the which
  For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
  A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MMCCCLXXXIV - "DNOTTHYSHOWTHE"

  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  Nor I nor any man that but man is
  O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
  There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
  That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
  His insolence draws folly from my lips;
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
  Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
  The wager thou hast won; and I will add
  Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MMCCCLXXXV - "NTHOUALONEKING"

  Necessity will make us all forsworn
  These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
  I will not hear her speak; away with her!
  Never to part with it; and here he stands;
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.


MMCCCLXXXVI - "DOMSOFHEARTSSH"

  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  Send for your ring, I will return it home,
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  For in my death I murder shameful scorn:
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
  So should the lines of life that life repair,
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.


MMCCCLXXXVII - "OULDSTOWENOLON"

  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
  Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
  The fountain from the which my current runs,
  Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.


MMCCCLXXXVIII - "GERMOURNFORMEW"

  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  For the base matter to illuminate
  Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!


MMCCCLXXXIX - "HENIAMDEADTHEN"

  He, being in the vaward, placed behind
  Even for this let us divided live,
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  I' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
  All length is torture: since the torch is out,
  My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.


MMCCCXC - "YOUSHALLHEARTH"

  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
  Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
  Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
  Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
  And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  He hath not told us of the captain yet:
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  And rather choose to hide them in a net
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
  Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.


MMCCCXCI - "ESURLYSULLENBE"

  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
  By any understanding pate but thine?
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MMCCCXCII - "LLGIVEWARNINGT"

  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Go with your impositions, I am yours
  If you will take a homely man's advice,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
  And go indeed, having so good a mean.
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  I would have had thee there, and here again,
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.


MMCCCXCIII - "OTHEWORLDTHATI"

  Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
  Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
  His love, perceiving how he is enraged,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
  O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Divide your happy England into four;
  Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
  And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.


MMCCCXCIV - "AMFLEDFROMTHIS"

  A distance from her; while her grace sat down
  My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
  For quick accumulation of renown,
  Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  March all one way and be no more opposed
  To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
  So is it in the music of men's lives.


MMCCCXCV - "VILEWORLDWITHV"

  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  In supplication nod: and my young boy
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
  Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Do me the favour to dilate at full
  We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMCCCXCVI - "ILESTWORMSTODW"

  It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  There's magic in thy majesty, which has
  With whom my soul is any jot at odds
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  What is your quarrel? how began it first?


MMCCCXCVII - "ELLNAYIFYOUREA"

  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
  You have great reason to do Richard right;
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  Fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
  Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
  O masters, if I were disposed to stir
  Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  And equity exiled your highness' land.


MMCCCXCVIII - "DTHISLINEREMEM"

  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
  Infected as her life, she would not live
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
  I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains
  No honourable trust. I have done ill;
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.


MMCCCXCIX - "BERNOTTHEHANDT"

  Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
  O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
  That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
  Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
  As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Never so little show of love to her,
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  That like a football you do spurn me thus?


MMCD - "HATWRITITFORIL"

  Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
  And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  It shall as level to your judgment pierce
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  In war was never lion raged more fierce,
  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.


MMCDI - "OVEYOUSOTHATII"

  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Even for this let us divided live,
  You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
  Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
  His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
  As full of grief as age; wretched in both.
  This is the very coinage of your brain.
  If you do keep your promises in love
  I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.


MMCDII - "NYOURSWEETTHOU"

  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
  Young lords, beware! and should the empress know
  Of one or both of us the time is come.
  Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
  Whither away, or where is thy abode?
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Unless he live until he be a man.


MMCDIII - "GHTSWOULDBEFOR"

  Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
  Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
  So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
  What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
  Of present dues: the future comes apace:
  Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
  Doth any name particular belong
  Because she will admit no kind of suit,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
  O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.


MMCDIV - "GOTIFTHINKINGO"

  Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
  For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
  To dispossess that child which is not his?
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  If there be nothing new, but that which is
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.


MMCDV - "NMETHENSHOULDM"

  Never went with his forces into France
  My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
  He fighteth as one weary of his life.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
  Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
  His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.


MMCDVI - "AKEYOUWOEOIFIS"

  Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
  Killing in relapse of mortality.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Yet let her be a principality,
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
  Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
  On him I lay what you would lay on me,
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  For such things in a false disloyal knave
  If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
  So near the cradle of the fairy queen?


MMCDVII - "AYYOULOOKUPONT"

  As far as land will let me, by your side.
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  You understand me- over and beside
  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Upon the next occasion that we meet,
  Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
  Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  That I have been thus pleasant with you both.


MMCDVIII - "HISVERSEWHENIP"

  How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
  If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
  So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
  In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
  Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?


MMCDIX - "ERHAPSCOMPOUND"

  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  His rudeness so with his authorized youth
  And answer me declined, sword against sword,
  Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
  O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
  Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
  Drove back again unto my native clime?


MMCDX - "EDAMWITHCLAYDO"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
  Are now become enamour'd on his grave.
  My faculties nor person, yet will be
  Whereof we have record, trial did draw
  I grant I am a woman; but withal
  Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
  Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
  Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
  Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
  Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
  Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  O, very well; I have perus'd the note.


MMCDXI - "NOTSOMUCHASMYP"

  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  There is a prohibition so divine
  She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  May the two latter darken and expend;
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Can any way speak in his just commend;
  Hear from me still, and never of me aught
  Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Perchance you think too much of so much pains?


MMCDXII - "OORNAMEREHEARS"

  O, know he is the bridle of your will.
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  And none your foes but such as shall pretend
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Seditious to his grace and to the state.


MMCDXIII - "EBUTLETYOURLOV"

  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
  Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
  You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
  Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMCDXIV - "EEVENWITHMYLIF"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
  I have no ears to his request. The queen
  The fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
  Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
  My soul doth tell my body that he may
  You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
  Like an unseasonable stormy day,
  It is most true; true, I have married her:
  For you shall hop without my custom, sir.


MMCDXV - "EDECAYLESTTHEW"

  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
  And to your quick-conceiving discontents
  You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
  That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
  The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!


MMCDXVI - "ISEWORLDSHOULD"

  If they surcease to be that should survive.
  Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  With such a kind of love as might become
  Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
  He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Let fair humanity abhor the deed
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.


MMCDXVII - "LOOKINTOYOURMO"

  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
  I have a king's oath to the contrary.
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
  Under these hard conditions as this time
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  May be put from her by society:
  O cruel, irreligious piety!


MMCDXVIII - "ANANDMOCKYOUWI"

  Away, for your relief! and we will live
  Nor do I as an enemy to peace
  A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
  Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
  Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
  Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  Which if we find outweighs ability,
  I thank my God for my humility.


MMCDXIX - "THMEAFTERIAMGO"

  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
  Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
  Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
  The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  If I depart from thee, I cannot live;
  And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
  Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
  Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
  O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?


MMCDXX - "NEOLESTTHEWORL"

  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Of his profession, that his good receipt
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


MMCDXXI - "DSHOULDTASKYOU"

  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  As likely to be blest in peace and war;
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
  You may as well forbid the mountain pines
  One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.


MMCDXXII - "TORECITEWHATME"

  To his confine; and of the truth herein
  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  And so have I a noble father lost;
  The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
  Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMCDXXIII - "RITLIVEDINMETH"

  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  In that each of you have forsworn his book,
  To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Durst not presume to look once in the face.
  I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
  Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
  My swift command, though I with death and with
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
  Have stood against the world; now lies he there.


MMCDXXIV - "ATYOUSHOULDLOV"

  Against the churches; though the yesty waves
  They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
  You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Upon so soft a subject as myself!
  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
  He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MMCDXXV - "EAFTERMYDEATHD"

  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  And leave us to our free election.
  From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
  Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
  You find him like a soldier: do not take
  Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  And the device he bears upon his shield
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.


MMCDXXVI - "EARLOVEFORGETM"

  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And what obscured in this fair volume lies
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
  O, had they in that darksome prison died!
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.


MMCDXXVII - "EQUITEFORYOUIN"

  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
  Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  For treason is but trusted like the fox,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.


MMCDXXVIII - "MECANNOTHINGWO"

  My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
  As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,
  Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
  Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
  With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.


MMCDXXIX - "RTHYPROVEUNLES"

  Reserve their character with golden quill
  That westward rooteth from the city's side,
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  You understand me- over and beside
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  On late offenders, that he now doth lack
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  She carry armour as she hath begun.


MMCDXXX - "SYOUWOULDDEVIS"

  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
  Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.


MMCDXXXI - "ESOMEVIRTUOUSL"

  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
  Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
  Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
  Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
  Let him be brought into the orchard here.


MMCDXXXII - "IETODOMOREFORM"

  If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
  O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
  Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:
  Of that and all the progress, more or less,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  For what I will, I will, and there an end.
  O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Make something nothing by augmenting it.


MMCDXXXIII - "ETHANMINEOWNDE"

  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  Holds disputation with each thing she views,
  And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  May yet ere night yield both my life and them
  I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  While it doth study to have what it would
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMCDXXXIV - "SERTANDHANGMOR"

  Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
  That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
  And Brutus is an honourable man.
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
  Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
  Of disobedient opposition
  Remember so weak a composition.


MMCDXXXV - "EPRAISEUPONDEC"

  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
  Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.


MMCDXXXVI - "EASEDITHANNIGG"

  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Affliction till it do cry out itself
  Since I have your good leave to go away,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Do summon us to part and bid good night.
  In any breast of strong authority,
  To honour Helen and to be her knight!
  Holds from all soldiers chief majority
  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
  Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,
  Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?


MMCDXXXVII - "ARDTRUTHWOULDW"

  Although they wear their faces to the bent
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
  Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
  Doing the execution and the act
  What is the course and drift of your compact?


MMCDXXXVIII - "ILLINGLYIMPART"

  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
  Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
  If I could shake off but one seven years
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
  Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
  Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
  And my estate deserves an heir more raised
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  To a loud trumpet and a point of war?


MMCDXXXIX - "OLESTYOURTRUEL"

  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
  The fountain from the which my current runs,
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.


MMCDXL - "OVEMAYSEEMFALS"

  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
  And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
  Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
  She shall be habited as it becomes
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
  Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
  And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
  Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
  Study to break it and not break my troth.


MMCDXLI - "EINTHISTHATYOU"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
  Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
  Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  Together with that fair and warlike form
  How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
  And rotten times that you shall look upon
  That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
  You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
  Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.


MMCDXLII - "FORLOVESPEAKWE"

  For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  O good old man, how well in thee appears
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


MMCDXLIII - "LLOFMEUNTRUEMY"

  Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
  Love can transpose to form and dignity:
  Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
  From him that fled some strange indignity,
  My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
  Not possible; for who shall bear your part
  The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
  You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?


MMCDXLIV - "NAMEBEBURIEDWH"

  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
  My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
  Upon my head and all this famous land.
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  I would the college of the cardinals
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
  Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.


MMCDXLV - "EREMYBODYISAND"

  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
  But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
  Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
  Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
  I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
  Such harmless creatures have a true respect
  And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
  Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
  During the time Edward the Third did reign.


MMCDXLVI - "LIVENOMORETOSH"

  Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
  I spake unto this crown as having sense,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
  My love admits no qualifying dross;
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  One of her women lawyer to me, for
  Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
  He see me, you shall see him nod at me.


MMCDXLVII - "AMENORMENORYOU"

  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.


MMCDXLVIII - "FORIAMSHAMEDBY"

  For this is from the present--how you take
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  In courtly company or at my beads,
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
  Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
  He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
  And in thy best consideration check
  Making both it unable for itself,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Do shameful execution on herself.
  But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
  You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.


MMCDXLIX - "THATWHICHIBRIN"

  That youth is surely in their company.
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
  Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
  He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
  I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
  Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
  How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
  I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  By this time, had the king permitted us,
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.


MMCDL - "GFORTHANDSOSHO"

  Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
  For what offence have I this fortnight been
  O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
  Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
  Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot;
  Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
  So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  O insupportable and touching loss!


MMCDLI - "ULDYOUTOLOVETH"

  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
  O noble prince, I can discover all
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
  Of dire combustion and confused events
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?


MMCDLII - "INGSNOTHINGWOR"

  Inferring arguments of mighty force.
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
  Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
  Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
  Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?


MMCDLIII - "THTHATTIMEOFYE"

  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
  How these things came about. So shall you hear
  Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
  Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
  A special party, have, by common voice,
  That rage in savage sensuality.
  To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
  In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
  Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MMCDLIV - "ARTHOUMAYSTINM"

  Any beginning to this peevish odds;
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods
  Hear from me still, and never of me aught
  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
  Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
  More said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
  Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
  That grew the more by reaping: his delights
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.


MMCDLV - "EBEHOLDWHENYEL"

  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  He took my father grossly, full of bread,
  O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
  Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
  With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
  How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.


MMCDLVI - "LOWLEAVESORNON"

  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
  Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
  Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  And chastise with the valour of my tongue
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
  O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
  Never to speak of this that you have seen.


MMCDLVII - "EORFEWDOHANGUP"

  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Of this great sport together, as you guess?
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!


MMCDLVIII - "ONTHOSEBOUGHSW"

  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
  Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;
  Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  What says Andronicus to this device?


MMCDLIX - "HICHSHAKEAGAIN"

  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
  His rudeness so with his authorized youth
  So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
  Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
  As closely to conceal what we impart:
  Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  And bloody England into England gone,
  Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
  Is marching hitherward in proud array,
  Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?


MMCDLX - "STTHECOLDBARER"

  Swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
  The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
  Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Death is the fairest cover for her shame
  Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
  And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.


MMCDLXI - "UINDCHOIRSWHER"

  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
  Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Command an argosy to stem the waves.
  Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
  Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
  I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
  When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
  Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


MMCDLXII - "ELATETHESWEETB"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
  And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
  The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  So under his insulting falchion lies
  Where these two Christian armies might combine
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  That souls of animals infuse themselves
  Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.


MMCDLXIII - "IRDSSANGINMETH"

  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
  Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  So fly I from her that would be my wife.
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
  Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
  My oath, and my profession. I protest-
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.


MMCDLXIV - "OUSEESTTHETWIL"

  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Environed with a wilderness of sea,
  Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
  To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
  That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
  Here at my house and at my proper cost.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
  What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
  If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.


MMCDLXV - "IGHTOFSUCHDAYA"

  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  To one so meek, that mine own servant should
  Or nicely charge your understanding soul
  For Mowbray and myself are like two men
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  And out of question so it is sometimes,
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  And for his safety there I'll best devise.


MMCDLXVI - "SAFTERSUNSETFA"

  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
  For he went sickly forth: and take good note
  The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  From him that fled some strange indignity,
  And still enjoy thy regal dignity.


MMCDLXVII - "DETHINTHEWESTW"

  Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  I do repent it from my very soul.
  Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Who in this dull and long-continued truce
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
  Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.


MMCDLXVIII - "HICHBYANDBYBLA"

  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
  If ever man were moved with woman moans,
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
  Yet once again, to make us public sport,
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  Not portable, lie under this report:
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
  Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
  And venture madly on a desperate mart.


MMCDLXIX - "CKNIGHTDOTHTAK"

  Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  If case some one of you would fly from us,
  Great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
  He that helps him take all my outward worth.
  Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
  The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
  And they have served me to effectless use:
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MMCDLXX - "EAWAYDEATHSSEC"

  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  And how unwillingly I left the ring,
  What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
  Though more to know could not be more to trust,
  Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
  She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
  Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!


MMCDLXXI - "ONDSELFTHATSEA"

  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
  For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
  The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
  So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.


MMCDLXXII - "LSUPALLINRESTI"

  Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  And for your rapier most especially,
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Labour and effect one thing specially.
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
  I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.


MMCDLXXIII - "NMETHOUSEESTTH"

  Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
  My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  That some would sing, some other in their bills
  Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
  Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  So much I challenge that I may profess
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  The rather by these arguments of fear,
  Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?


MMCDLXXIV - "EGLOWINGOFSUCH"

  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Or on Diana's altar to protest
  Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
  I am not in the giving vein to-day.
  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
  Of dear import, and the neglecting it
  For which the heavens, taking angry note,
  So many guests invite as here are writ.
  Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  How far that little candle throws his beams!


MMCDLXXV - "FIRETHATONTHEA"

  For this they have been thoughtful to invest
  In such a time as this it is not meet
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  And say you do't by our permission;
  Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
  Omitting the sweet benefit of time
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
  His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.


MMCDLXXVI - "SHESOFHISYOUTH"

  So many guests invite as here are writ.
  Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
  Of this most fair occasion, by the which
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  I have a mind presages me such thrift,
  Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  That his own hand may strike his honour down
  How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?


MMCDLXXVII - "DOTHLIEASTHEDE"

  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  Of your best graces in your mind; the which
  The choice and master spirits of this age.
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
  I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  And have is have, however men do catch:
  Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
  The pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
  Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMCDLXXVIII - "ATHBEDWHEREONI"

  As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
  To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
  When Collatine unwisely did not let
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.


MMCDLXXIX - "TMUSTEXPIRECON"

  Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
  My chaplain to no creature living, but
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
 eXpect him here: when he shall come and find
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.


MMCDLXXX - "SUMEDWITHTHATW"

  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
  We may of their encounter frankly judge
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  He will recover straight: when he is gone,
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
  The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
  Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.


MMCDLXXXI - "HICHITWASNOURI"

  Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Collected choicely, from each county some,
  Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
  In kissing, do you render or receive?
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
  As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
  Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
  Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
  Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  I shall not look upon his like again.


MMCDLXXXII - "SHDBYTHISTHOUP"

  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
  But with her most vile principal, that she's
  You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
  Start not; her actions shall be holy as
  The other, that he do record a gift,
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?


MMCDLXXXIII - "ERCEIVESTWHICH"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Crush him together rather than unfold
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
  That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
  Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
  Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
  Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
  He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.


MMCDLXXXIV - "MAKESTHYLOVEMO"

  My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
  And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
  His foes are so enrooted with his friends
  You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
  Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?


MMCDLXXXV - "RESTRONGTOLOVE"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
  Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
  Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
  Of any thing the image tell me that
  Lest that it make me so unsound a man
  Of such contents as you will wonder at;
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMCDLXXXVI - "THATWELLWHICHT"

  That he misconstrues all that you have done.
  How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
  And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.
  This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
  What, urge you your petitions in the street?
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
  When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
  Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  Could not again undo: it was mine art,
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!
  The crown of England, father, which is yours.


MMCDLXXXVII - "HOUMUSTLEAVEER"

  Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
  To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!


MMCDLXXXVIII - "ELONGBUTBECONT"

  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  O, had they in that darksome prison died!
  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
  Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;
  But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
  Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
  The custom of request you have discharged:
  Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
  Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.


MMCDLXXXIX - "ENTEDWHENTHATF"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  That right in peace which here we urge in war,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
  Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
  He had no other deathsman. Let us see.
  And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:
  Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.
  For he himself is subject to his birth.


MMCDXC - "ELLARRESTWITHO"

  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
  This is a poor epitome of yours,
  Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
  I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
  The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
  How easy is it, then! Your constancy
  O foul revolt of French inconstancy!


MMCDXCI - "UTALLBAILSHALL"

  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
  As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  But like of each thing that in season grows.
  As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
  In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
  Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
  Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
  Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.


MMCDXCII - "CARRYMEAWAYMYL"

  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
  And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
  Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
  And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
  You may as well do anything most hard,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.


MMCDXCIII - "IFEHATHINTHISL"

  I have done penance for contemning Love,
  Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
  And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
  That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
  How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
  See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.


MMCDXCIV - "INESOMEINTERES"

  Is all the policy, strength and defence,
  No more pains for those thanks than you took pains
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  Of fool and feather that they got in France,
  May they not be my oracles as well,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
  The better act of purposes mistook
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.


MMCDXCV - "TWHICHFORMEMOR"

  That had befall'n us. As we paced along
  Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
  High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  For we are peremptory to dispatch
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  Return again, and take an oath with thee.
  Makes me the bolder to salute my king
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  More relative than this. The play's the thing
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MMCDXCVI - "IALSTILLWITHTH"

  I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
  As a long-parted mother with her child
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
  In number more than ever women spoke,
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  What comfortable hour canst thou name,
  In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
  There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
  Her father is no better than an earl,
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?


MMCDXCVII - "EESHALLSTAYWHE"

  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
  Have studied physic, through which secret art,
  A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
  Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
  Whilst emulation in the army crept:
  Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMCDXCVIII - "NTHOUREVIEWEST"

  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  That so he might recover what was lost.


MMCDXCIX - "THISTHOUDOSTRE"

  This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
  His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
  Is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
  That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
  Hath he excepted most against my love.
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
  O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMD - "VIEWTHEVERYPAR"

  Values itself so highly that to her
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
  This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
  Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
  Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.


MMDI - "TWASCONSECRATE"

  The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
  Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
  And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
  Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Now do I long to hear how you were found;
  Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  And he hath won what he would lose again:
  This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMDII - "TOTHEETHEEARTH"

  Thy temples should be planted presently
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  To my keen curses; for without my wrong
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
  Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?


MMDIII - "CANHAVEBUTEART"

  Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
  And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
  Not able to endure the sight of day,
  His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
  And in this private plot be we the first
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind.


MMDIV - "HWHICHISHISDUE"

  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
  Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMDV - "MYSPIRITISTHIN"

  Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
  Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
  She is a woman, therefore to be won.
  Probal to thinking and indeed the course
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
  Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
  I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
  I will requite you with as good a thing;
  Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.


MMDVI - "ETHEBETTERPART"

  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  His antidotes are poison, and he slays
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  But miserable most, to love unloved?
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  That may repeat and history his los
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
  Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
  Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.


MMDVII - "OFMESOTHENTHOU"

  Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
  For yet his honour never heard a play,
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
  O, had the gods done so, I had not now
  To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
  Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
  That give a name to every fixed star
  Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
  O, what a mansion have those vices got
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.


MMDVIII - "HASTBUTLOSTTHE"

  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  And to fulfil his prince' desire,
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
  Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
  That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
  He sends you this most memorable line,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MMDIX - "DREGSOFLIFETHE"

  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
  Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
  Far be it we should honour such as these
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  That holds his honour higher than his ease,
  How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMDX - "PREYOFWORMSMYB"

  Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  You drew your sword upon me without cause;
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  From open haunts and popularity.
  We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
  So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
  My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!
  You shall enjoy them, everything set off
  By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!


MMDXI - "ODYBEINGDEADTH"

  One that made means to come by what he hath,
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  You were conducted to a gentle bath
  But great men tremble when the lion roars;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
  Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  That with the king here resteth in his tent?
  His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.


MMDXII - "ECOWARDCONQUES"

  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Conceptions only proper to myself,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Which is as dear to me as life itself;
  An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.


MMDXIII - "TOFAWRETCHSKNI"

  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Or, being open, put into his hands
  Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
  And all the number of his fair demands
  With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  That we may be admitted where he is.
  Came short of composition, but in chief
  He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
  Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  I that do bring the news made not the match.


MMDXIV - "FETOOBASEOFTHE"

  From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  One time or other break some gallows' back.
  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
  All things in common nature should produce
  So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
  That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
  He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMDXV - "ETOBEREMEMBERE"

  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  Or the light loss of England for a friend:
  By him that made us all, I am resolved
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Make war against proportion'd course of time;
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
  But did you not request to have it cut?
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMDXVI - "DTHEWORTHOFTHA"

  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  He weeps for her, for she was only mine,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Will take again your queen as yours at first,
  One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
  Or else I'll call my brother back again,
  From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
  Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  And Somerset another goodly mast?


MMDXVII - "TISTHATWHICHIT"

  Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
  I do pronounce him in that very shape
  Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
  The happy tidings of his good escape.
  Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?
  He needs no indirect nor lawless course
  I am resolved to bear a greater storm
  Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
  Had not been here to dress the ugly form
  Indeed we heard how near his death he was
  Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.


MMDXVIII - "CONTAINSANDTHA"

  Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
  Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
  None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
  The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
  A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  And cuts me from the best of all my land
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
  Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.


MMDXIX - "TISTHISANDTHIS"

  Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
  Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
  That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
  And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.
  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.


MMDXX - "WITHTHEEREMAIN"

  Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
  In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
  And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
  It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.


MMDXXI - "SSOAREYOUTOMYT"

  Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Yet nature is made better by no mean
  Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
  My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  Treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.


MMDXXII - "HOUGHTSASFOODT"

  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
  Still your own foes, deliver you as most
  A little water clears us of this deed:
  Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
  For how can tyrants safely govern home,
  Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  The end of this day's business ere it come!


MMDXXIII - "OLIFEORASSWEET"

  O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
  Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
  I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
  For we no longer are defensible.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Of celebration of that nuptial which
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  And say there is no sin but to be rich;
  Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
  Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
  Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.


MMDXXIV - "SEASONDSHOWERS"

  Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
  Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
  Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Remember since you owed no more to time
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.


MMDXXV - "ARETOTHEGROUND"

  As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Going to find a bare-foot brother out
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
  Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!


MMDXXVI - "ANDFORTHEPEACE"

  As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
  No public benefit which you receive
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
  Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  That art to me as secret and as dear
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
  Can never be so equal, that your love
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMDXXVII - "OFYOUIHOLDSUCH"

  Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
  For God doth know how many now in health
  You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Upon the head of valour; which indeed
  In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
  He may surrender; so we shall proceed
  On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
  Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
  Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
  So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!


MMDXXVIII - "STRIFEASTWIXTA"

  Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
  Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
  So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
  I could have well diverted her intents,
 eXcept it be to pray against thy foes.
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  As dear be to thee as thy father was.


MMDXXIX - "MISERANDHISWEA"

  Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
  I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
  So he be dead; for that is good deceit
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
  Not knowing how to find the open air,
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
  I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
  See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
  Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  And lookest to command the prince and realm.


MMDXXX - "LTHISFOUNDNOWP"

  Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
  Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
  For by the image of my cause I see
  Only to herald thee into his sight,
  Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
  One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
  We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.


MMDXXXI - "ROUDASANENJOYE"

  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  O, that I could but call these dead to life!
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
  Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
  Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
  And in thy best consideration check
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMDXXXII - "RANDANONDOUBTI"

  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  Unless some dull and favourable hand
  But he will not entreat his son for us.
  Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
  I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.


MMDXXXIII - "NGTHEFILCHINGA"

  Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
  Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
  I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  Insinuation, parley and base truce
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
  And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.


MMDXXXIV - "GEWILLSTEALHIS"

  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
  I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  And in thy best consideration check
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
  So it should seem by that I have to say.


MMDXXXV - "TREASURENOWCOU"

  Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
  O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
  Where bloody murder or detested rape
  Commanded always by the greater gust;
  On what condition stands it and wherein?
  Upon the love you bear me, get you in.


MMDXXXVI - "NTINGBESTTOBEW"

  Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  Grow great by your example and put on
  But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
  That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  O benefit of ill! now I find true
  Before his sister should her body stoop
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?


MMDXXXVII - "ITHYOUALONETHE"

  In confutation of which rude reproach
  There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
  He saves my labour by his own approach.
  You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
  Look that you take upon you as you should.
  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  There is your money that I had to keep.
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMDXXXVIII - "NBETTERDTHATTH"

  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  The confirmation of my promised gift,
  That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  Almost no better than so many French;
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
  How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad!


MMDXXXIX - "EWORLDMAYSEEMY"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  What we can do to him, though now the time
  Of any kindred action like to this?
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
  Strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
  Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.


MMDXL - "PLEASURESOMETI"

  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  And throw between them all the food thou hast,
  So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  O, that your face were not so full of O's!
  Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Takes on the point of honour to support
  If Warwick be so near as men report.


MMDXLI - "MEALLFULLWITHF"

  My soul and body on the action both!
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
  With those gross taunts I often have endured.
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
  His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
  For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?


MMDXLII - "EASTINGONYOURS"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
  Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
  Upon your oath of service to the pope,
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.


MMDXLIII - "IGHTANDBYANDBY"

  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
  He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
  Than for your lady's. You may gather more.
  And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
  You look as you had something more to say.
  And, of so great a favour growing proud,
  Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  But did you not request to have it cut?
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.


MMDXLIV - "CLEANSTARVEDFO"

  Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  And to fulfil his prince' desire,
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
  That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
  For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
  Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!


MMDXLV - "RALOOKPOSSESSI"

  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
  O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
  Such as I love; and you, among the store,
  So much against the mettle of your sex,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.


MMDXLVI - "NGORPURSUINGNO"

  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
  Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  I never swore this lady such an oath.
  Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
  Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.


MMDXLVII - "DELIGHTSAVEWHA"

  Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
  In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
  Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  The commons, like an angry hive of bees
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
  Hath set the women on to this complaint:
  And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.


MMDXLVIII - "TISHADORMUSTFR"

  They did not bless us with one happy word.
  I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
  Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
  Her father is no better than an earl,
  And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
  Rather than make unprofited return.


MMDXLIX - "OMYOUBETOOKTHU"

  Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
  Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
  Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
  Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
  The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.


MMDL - "SDOIPINEANDSUR"

  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  I and my bosom must debate awhile,
  Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
  I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  And fit it with such furniture as suits
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
  Score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MMDLI - "FEITDAYBYDAYOR"

  For being ignorant to whom it goes
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
  These banish'd men that I have kept withal
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  But in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
  You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MMDLII - "GLUTTONINGONAL"

  Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  To place upon the volume of your deeds,
  That here were well begun and well begot;
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Nor ask advice of any other thought
  I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
  As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.


MMDLIII - "LORALLAWAYWHYI"

  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
  Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  And some donation freely to estate
  Which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.


MMDLIV - "SMYVERSESOBARR"

  Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
  My father came untimely to his death?
  You come to take your stand here, and behold
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
  Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
  By looking back what I have left behind
  As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.


MMDLV - "ENOFNEWPRIDESO"

  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
  For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
  Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?


MMDLVI - "FARFROMVARIATI"

  From this enormous state, seeking to give
  A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  If he for gold will give us any food;
  Although against her will, as it appears
  That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
  In the contempt and anger of his lip!


MMDLVII - "ONORQUICKCHANG"

  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.
  Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
  Know you how much the people may be moved
  Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights,
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.


MMDLVIII - "EWHYWITHTHETIM"

  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
  How can you say to me, I am a king?
  Your lady's love against some other maid
  Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  That the magnifico is much beloved,
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  That it will live engraven in my face.
  Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
  In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.


MMDLIX - "EDOINOTGLANCEA"

  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
  I' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
  And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.


MMDLX - "SIDETONEWFOUND"

  So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
  Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
  No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
  Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
  Unto a woman, happy but for me,
  Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?


MMDLXI - "METHODSANDTOCO"

  My army but a weak and sickly guard;
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
  Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  Doing the execution and the act
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Are of imagination all compact:
  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?


MMDLXII - "MPOUNDSSTRANGE"

  Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
  Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  Now is this golden crown like a deep well
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
  Save base authority from others' books
  The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
  Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MMDLXIII - "WHYWRITEISTILL"

  What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
  To make a shaking fever in your walls,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  In courtly company or at my beads,
  Say their great enemy is gone, and they
  To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
  Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.


MMDLXIV - "ALLONEEVERTHES"

  Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
  Let fair humanity abhor the deed
  Looking before and after, gave us not
  O, some authority how to proceed;
  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  To hear the story of your life, which must
  Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.


MMDLXV - "AMEANDKEEPINVE"

  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!
  In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMDLXVI - "NTIONINANOTEDW"

  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
  I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
  None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
  And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
  Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Welcome him then according to his worth.


MMDLXVII - "EEDTHATEVERYWO"

  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  And nothing marted with him. If your lass
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?


MMDLXVIII - "RDDOTHALMOSTTE"

  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  Do you set down your name in the scroll of
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
  Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
  More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
  Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
  The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


MMDLXIX - "LLMYNAMESHOWIN"

  Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  My life itself, and the best heart of it,
  You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Were very pregnant and potential spurs
  I have no will to wander forth of doors,
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.


MMDLXX - "GTHEIRBIRTHAND"

  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
  How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  In liberty of bloody hand shall range
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
  I stand accountant for as great a sin,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  Have you not made an universal shout,
  A night is but small breath and little pause
  Now does my project gather to a head:
  During the life, let us not wrong it dead.


MMDLXXI - "WHERETHEYDIDPR"

  Were poor and single business to contend
  How bloodily the sun begins to peer
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
  Do the part of an honest man in it.
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


MMDLXXII - "OCEEDOKNOWSWEE"

  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
  Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
  She carry armour as she hath begun.
  With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


MMDLXXIII - "TLOVEIALWAYSWR"

  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  Are now to examination these men.
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
  With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
  And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
  With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!


MMDLXXIV - "ITEOFYOUANDYOU"

  I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
  The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones;
  Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
  You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Am I a queen in title and in style,
  Not able to endure the sight of day,
  Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
  Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
  O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
  Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?


MMDLXXV - "ANDLOVEARESTIL"

  Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  A better speech was never spoke before;
  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
  Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
  Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
  Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.


MMDLXXVI - "LMYARGUMENTSOA"

  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
  You do it for increase: O strange excuse,
  And often reading what contents it bears;
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.
  Under the service of a child as soon
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
  Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
  Are you now going to dispatch this deed?


MMDLXXVII - "LLMYBESTISDRES"

  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  My lord's almost so far transported that
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  The next thing then she waking looks upon,
  Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.


MMDLXXVIII - "SINGOLDWORDSNE"

  Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
  I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Let those who are in favour with their stars
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
  Or nicely charge your understanding soul
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MMDLXXIX - "WSPENDINGAGAIN"

  Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  Patricians and plebeians, we create
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
  If half thy outward graces had been placed
  Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
  Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  As well I tender you and all of yours!
  Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
  And dangerous success of bloody wars,
  If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.


MMDLXXX - "WHATISALREADYS"

  Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  And for thy life let justice be accused.
  The people know it; and have now received
  I am resolved to bear a greater storm
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  Acquitted by a true substantial form,
  La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  And then the moon, like to a silver bow
  Descended of so many royal kings.
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.


MMDLXXXI - "PENTFORASTHESU"

  Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
  To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass
  For valiant doings in their country's cause?
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--
  Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?


MMDLXXXII - "NISDAILYNEWAND"

  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Scorn and derision never come in tears:
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
  Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
  And turn'd it thus,' It cannot be, I find,
  Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.


MMDLXXXIII - "OLDSOISMYLOVES"

  Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
  Last, and as much containing as all these,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Should a like language use to all degrees
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
  She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
  My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
  Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  See where she comes from shrift with merry look.


MMDLXXXIV - "TILLTELLINGWHA"

  They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
  I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Lays open all the little worms that creep;
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  I thought upon one pair of English legs
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
  Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice;
  His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.


MMDLXXXV - "TISTOLDTHYGLAS"

  This discord's ground, the music would not please.
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
  That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  This is not strong enough to be believed
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
  Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.


MMDLXXXVI - "SWILLSHOWTHEEH"

  Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
  Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
  Infected be the air whereon they ride;
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  When time is broke and no proportion kept!
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  His meaning struck her ere his words begun.


MMDLXXXVII - "OWTHYBEAUTIESW"

  O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
  We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
  But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  As many as be here of pander's hall,
  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
  To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
  Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!


MMDLXXXVIII - "EARTHYDIALHOWT"

  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
  Have I not strove to love, although I knew
  You would have them always play but one thing?
  Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  I come with gracious offers from the king,
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
  Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.


MMDLXXXIX - "HYPRECIOUSMINU"

  Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
  If you may please to think I love the king
  O Antony, beg not your death of us.
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
  Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.


MMDXC - "TESWASTETHEVAC"

  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
  Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
  Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
  Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
  His phoenix down began but to appear
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  And if the boy have not a woman's gift
  Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!


MMDXCI - "ANTLEAVESTHYMI"

  A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
  Her beauty and the value of her dower,
  You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
  May the two latter darken and expend;
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.


MMDXCII - "NDSIMPRINTWILL"

  Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
  Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  I cannot give it vital growth again.
  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  When yond same star that's westward from the pole
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.


MMDXCIII - "BEARANDOFTHISB"

  By'r lady, he is a good musician.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  A precious ring, a ring that I must use
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
  For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
  To curb the will of the nobility:
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  I thank my God for my humility.
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.


MMDXCIV - "OOKTHISLEARNIN"

  On either side I come to spend my breath;
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Have we pass'd through, not without much content
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
  Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.


MMDXCV - "GMAYSTTHOUTAST"

  Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
  My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
  And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  Son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
  The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
  Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.


MMDXCVI - "ETHEWRINKLESWH"

  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  The kiss you take is better than you give;
  He is but one: you and my brother search
  Even for this let us divided live,
  With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
  Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
  Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.


MMDXCVII - "ICHTHYGLASSWIL"

  Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
  Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
  Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
  In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
  Love loving not itself none other can.


MMDXCVIII - "LTRULYSHOWOFMO"

  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
  Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Which is the hot condition of their blood;
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!


MMDXCIX - "UTHEDGRAVESWIL"

  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  To his most royal person, hither come
  Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
  God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
  It is extempore, from my mother wit.
  Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.


MMDC - "LGIVETHEEMEMOR"

  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  My speech should fall into such vile success
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!


MMDCI - "YTHOUBYTHYDIAL"

  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
  He takes it from the rushes where it lies,
  Your preparation can affront no less
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  In the old time of war, would shake the press,
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?


MMDCII - "SSHADYSTEALTHM"

  Set deadly enmity between two friends,
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
  Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.
  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
  Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
  That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  My husband bids me; now I will unmask.


MMDCIII - "AYSTKNOWTIMEST"

  According to the measure of their states.
  You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  Kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
  Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
  The king hath straitly charged the contrary.


MMDCIV - "HIEVISHPROGRES"

  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
  If haply you my father do suspect
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
  His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
  Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
  Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.


MMDCV - "STOETERNITYLOO"

  She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
  The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
  O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  If he should break his day, what should I gain
  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
  You four, from hence to prison back again;
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  O foul revolt of French inconstancy!


MMDCVI - "KWHATTHYMEMORY"

  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
  Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
  And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
  That die unmarried, ere they can behold
  Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
  He that will think to live till he be old,
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  My evils conjured to remembrance and
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  My matter is so rash: there is at hand
  Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.


MMDCVII - "CANNOTCONTAINC"

  Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
  And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
  Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
  Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
  Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  That rage in savage sensuality.
  And what we do establish he confirms:
  In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  Can sick men play so nicely with their names?


MMDCVIII - "OMMITTOTHESEWA"

  O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
  Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
  Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
  Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
  His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  When in that moment, so it came to pass,
  And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!


MMDCIX - "STEBLANKSANDTH"

  Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
  That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  King John, your king and England's doth approach,
  So long in his unlucky Irish wars
  And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Death is the fairest cover for her shame
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Have scarce strength left to give them burial.


MMDCX - "OUSHALTFINDTHO"

  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
  Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
  Stain'd with the variation of each soil
  How if your husband start some other where?
  And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
  Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
  Than from true evidence of good esteem
  From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
  I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
  Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
  He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
  Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.


MMDCXI - "SECHILDRENNURS"

  Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  I thank my God for my humility.
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?
  Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
  Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  So let us still continue peace and love.


MMDCXII - "EDDELIVERDFROM"

  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  If whilst I live she will be only mine.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  For time is like a fashionable host
  Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
  Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.


MMDCXIII - "THYBRAINTOTAKE"

  That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
  Have I not strove to love, although I knew
  You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
  Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  And what we do establish he confirms:
  If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
  That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMDCXIV - "ANEWACQUAINTAN"

  Anon, as patient as the female dove
  No might nor greatness in mortality
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  With words, fair looks and liberality?
  A noble duke, in nature as in name.
  Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
  Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
  Unto thy value I will mount myself
  At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
  If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
  And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!


MMDCXV - "CEOFTHYMINDTHE"

  Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
  He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  More than enough am I that vex thee still,
  It could not else be, I should prove so base,
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.


MMDCXVI - "SEOFFICESSOOFT"

  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  For certain words he spake against your grace
  Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
  I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
  Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
  O, with what wings shall his affections fly
  Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
  For forth he goes and visits all his host.
  The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?


MMDCXVII - "ASTHOUWILTLOOK"

  All. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
  He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
  Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
  I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  That never saw the giant world enraged;
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
  O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,
  Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?


MMDCXVIII - "SHALLPROFITTHE"

  So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMDCXIX - "EANDMUCHENRICH"

  Exist, and be a member of his love
  And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Now to deliver her possession up
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
  Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.


MMDCXX - "THYBOOKSOOFTHA"

  That rage in savage sensuality.
  He is well paid that is well satisfied;
  Yet let her be a principality,
  But that one half which is unsatisfied,
  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
  O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  For never-resting time leads summer on
  Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
  How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
  And so farewell until I meet thee next.


MMDCXXI - "VEIINVOKEDTHEE"

  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  I swear to do this, though a present death
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MMDCXXII - "FORMYMUSEANDFO"

  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  My lords ambassadors, your several suits
  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
  Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  Night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
  Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!


MMDCXXIII - "UNDSUCHFAIRASS"

  Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
  Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
  Deadly divorce step between me and you!
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Came from the north and thus it did import:
  He sends ye not to murder me for this
  For long agone I have forgot to court;
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  It follows in his thought that I am he.
  Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
  And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
  Still and contemplative in living art.
  See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.


MMDCXXIV - "ISTANCEINMYVER"

  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
  Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
  No bargains break that are not this day made:
  Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
  Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
  Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MMDCXXV - "SEASEVERYALIEN"

  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
  Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
  You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
  A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!


MMDCXXVI - "PENHATHGOTMYUS"

  Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
  Hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
  And more than carefully it us concerns
  Tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
  O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
  Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
  You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?


MMDCXXVII - "EANDUNDERTHEET"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
  Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  Unless a brother should a brother dare
  None wed the second but who killed the first.
  Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  To him that ever fears he shall be poor.


MMDCXXVIII - "HEIRPOESYDISPE"

  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
  Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMDCXXIX - "RSETHINEEYESTH"

  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
  Have I not here the best cards for the game,
  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
  Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  He saves my labour by his own approach.


MMDCXXX - "ATTAUGHTTHEDUM"

  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
  He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,
  To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
  Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
  Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!


MMDCXXXI - "BONHIGHTOSINGA"

  By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Her grief, but not her grief's true quality:
  I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
  Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
  I shall be reconciled to him again.
  Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
  Against his liking: think you it is so?


MMDCXXXII - "NDHEAVYIGNORAN"

  Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
  Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
  Give order to my servants that they take
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  Rest on my word, and let not discontent
  An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.


MMDCXXXIII - "CEALOFTTOFLYHA"

  Come, let us go: we will include all jars
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
  From any private malice in his end,
  That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
  The very principals did seem to rend,
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
  Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
  And come, young Cato; let us to the field.


MMDCXXXIV - "VEADDEDFEATHER"

  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  A most unhappy one: I would do much
  Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
  Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
  To make oppression bitter, or ere this
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MMDCXXXV - "STOTHELEARNEDS"

  Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
  To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
  Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.


MMDCXXXVI - "WINGANDGIVENGR"

  What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
  I am so angry at these abject terms;
  Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
  No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
  I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  No occupation; all men idle, all;
  God knows I had as lief be none as one.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MMDCXXXVII - "ACEADOUBLEMAJE"

  As she is prized to have--as to refuse
  Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
  Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MMDCXXXVIII - "STYYETBEMOSTPR"

  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
  Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
  Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.


MMDCXXXIX - "OUDOFTHATWHICH"

  O, torture me no more! I will confess.
  Until the elder sister first be wed.
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
  For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
  And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
  Thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
  When these so noble benefits shall prove
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.


MMDCXL - "ICOMPILEWHOSEI"

  I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
  Call for the music in the other room.
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
  Pretend some alteration in good will?
  I know but of a single part, in aught
  Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Or in my life what comfort, when I am
  Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!


MMDCXLI - "NFLUENCEISTHIN"

  No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
  Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  England, bound in with the triumphant sea
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
  Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
  Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  No more my grief, in such a precious loss.


MMDCXLII - "EANDBORNOFTHEE"

  Except some petty towns of no import:
  And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
  No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
  O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
  Or ne'er return again into my sight.
  Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
  The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
  How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMDCXLIII - "INOTHERSWORKST"

  I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
  Now, messenger, what letters or what news
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  So mighty and so many my defects,
  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
  O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?


MMDCXLIV - "HOUDOSTBUTMEND"

  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
  That now is lying in Marseilles road.
  But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?


MMDCXLV - "THESTYLEANDART"

  To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
  Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
  You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  And the device he bears upon his shield
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
  As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!


MMDCXLVI - "SWITHTHYSWEETG"

  Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
  With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
  I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
  Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.


MMDCXLVII - "RACESGRACEDBEB"

  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
  Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  And in his inward mind he doth debate
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  But carries on the stream of his dispose
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.


MMDCXLVIII - "UTTHOUARTALLMY"

  Upon the country where you make abode;
  The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
  Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
  And such high vaunts of his nobility,
  Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
  Losing both beauty and utility.
  My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
  York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.


MMDCXLIX - "ARTANDDOSTADVA"

  As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
  And many Jasons come in quest of her.
  Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
  That we meet here so strangely: but her son
  And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  And what I spake, I spake it to my face.


MMDCL - "NCEASHIGHASLEA"

  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  And here am I, and wode within this wood,
  Score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  I have a king's oath to the contrary.
  Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
  His antidotes are poison, and he slays
  All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
  Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.


MMDCLI - "RNINGMYRUDEIGN"

  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  You have your wish; my will is even this:
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Upon the love and truth and vows which I
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  In other accents do this praise confound
  God pardon them that are the cause of it!
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.


MMDCLII - "ORANCEWHILSTIA"

  Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
  Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
  I drink the air before me, and return
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  So that by this intelligence we learn
  Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.


MMDCLIII - "LONEDIDCALLUPO"

  Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
  O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
  And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!


MMDCLIV - "NTHYAIDMYVERSE"

  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;
  And of so easy and so plain a stop
  I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
  Master of this design, did give us, with
  You may as well do anything most hard,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MMDCLV - "ALONEHADALLTHY"

  Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
  And with my trespass never will dispense,
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  And to his hand when I deliver her,
  Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
  Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
  You, merchant, have you any thing to say?


MMDCLVI - "GENTLEGRACEBUT"

  Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  And chastise with the valour of my tongue
  Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  But now I died, and death was lively joy.
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.


MMDCLVII - "NOWMYGRACIOUSN"

  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
  When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
  More valour in me than my habits show.
  You smell this business with a sense as cold
  Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Acquainted me with interest to this land,
  Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
  If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Should many people, under two commands,
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.


MMDCLVIII - "UMBERSAREDECAY"

  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  My riches to the earth from whence they came;
  But your request shall make me let it pass.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
  And after summer evermore succeeds
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  A couching lion and a ramping cat,
  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.


MMDCLIX - "DANDMYSICKMUSE"

  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  As in these cases, where the aim reports,
  Nor thrust your head into the public street
  Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
  My chaplain to no creature living, but
  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
  Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MMDCLX - "DOTHGIVEANOTHE"

  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  The heir of kingdoms and another like
  He would have well becomed this place, and graced
  Gelding the opposed continent as much
  If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
  Of disobedient opposition
  This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
  Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMDCLXI - "RPLACEIGRANTSW"

  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
  Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?


MMDCLXII - "EETLOVETHYLOVE"

  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:
  Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
  On late offenders, that he now doth lack
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
  Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
  Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
  Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
  Of physiognomy might one behold!
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?


MMDCLXIII - "LYARGUMENTDESE"

  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
  And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Makes mouths at the invisible event,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  There shall no figure at such rate be set
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MMDCLXIV - "RVESTHETRAVAIL"

  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
  The king is kind; and well we know the king
  His love, perceiving how he is enraged,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Than honesty to honesty engaged,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  And sail so expeditious that shall catch
  Values itself so highly that to her
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.


MMDCLXV - "OFAWORTHIERPEN"

  O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
  For that which longer nurseth the disease,
  And grows to something of great constancy;
  Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,
  On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
  How often said, my dignity would last
  In what have I offended you? what cause
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  Not seeing what is likely to ensue.


MMDCLXVI - "YETWHATOFTHEET"

  Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
  With other princes that may best be spared,
  He held me last night at least nine hours
  Are of imagination all compact:
  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  For such things in a false disloyal knave
  The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.


MMDCLXVII - "HYPOETDOTHINVE"

  Here am I left to underprop his land,
  Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
  Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Of all the court and princes of my blood:
  The unity and married calm of states
  His wit set down to make his valour live
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMDCLXVIII - "NTHEROBSTHEEOF"

  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
  He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
  Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  There tell the king he may inquire us out.
  Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.


MMDCLXIX - "ANDPAYSITTHEEA"

  As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
  Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
  There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
  The fundamental reasons of this war,
  Have no more profit of their shining nights
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  And all for use of that which is mine own.


MMDCLXX - "GAINHELENDSTHE"

  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
  He hence removed last night and with more haste
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMDCLXXI - "EVIRTUEANDHEST"

  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  If by the way they be not fought withal.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
  Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
  That from it all consideration slips!


MMDCLXXII - "OLETHATWORDFRO"

  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  He likewise gives a frock or livery,
  And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
  That he would labour my delivery.
  Writ in the glassy margents of such books:
  O, pity, God, this miserable age!
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  For forth he goes and visits all his host.
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Of a glad father compass thee about!


MMDCLXXIII - "MTHYBEHAVIORBE"

  Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
  Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
  Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
  But that one half which is unsatisfied,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  He is well paid that is well satisfied;
  Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Blood and destruction shall be so in use
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.


MMDCLXXIV - "AUTYDOTHHEGIVE"

  As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
  You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  To hold your honour more precise and nice
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
  I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.


MMDCLXXV - "ANDFOUNDITINTH"

  A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
  Next month? and are they not some of them set
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  The love of wicked men converts to fear;
  How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?


MMDCLXXVI - "YCHEEKHECANAFF"

  You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
  Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
  High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Her father means she shall be all in white,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
  A merchant of incomparable wealth.
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  And, if it be so far beyond his health,
  Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
  For as I am, I live upon the rack.


MMDCLXXVII - "ORDNOPRAISETOT"

  O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
  It was excess of wine that set him on;
  Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
  Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
  Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.


MMDCLXXVIII - "HEEBUTWHATINTH"

  Have added feathers to the learned's wing
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
  Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
  Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:
  Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
  He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
  And leave us to our free election.
  To grosser issues nor to larger reach
  It shows my earnestness of affection-
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  To pluck his indignation on thy head
  Have I not reason to look pale and dead?


MMDCLXXIX - "EEDOTHLIVETHEN"

  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Do in his name religiously demand
  O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
  Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
  Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
  It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.


MMDCLXXX - "THANKHIMNOTFOR"

  Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
  Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
  He is a great observer and he looks
  If I be so disgracious in your sight,
  Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
  From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.


MMDCLXXXI - "THATWHICHHEDOT"

  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
  And to fulfil his prince' desire,
  This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;
  Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
  If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  He be as miserably slain as I.
  He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
  O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
  Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?


MMDCLXXXII - "HSAYSINCEWHATH"

  Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  And some are yet ungotten and unborn
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Set down, set down your honourable load,
  I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
  Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
  Any beginning to this peevish odds;
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.


MMDCLXXXIII - "EOWESTHEETHOUT"

  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
  Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Son to the elder brother of this man,
  To make some special instant special blest,
  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
  Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  The treasury of everlasting joy.


MMDCLXXXIV - "HYSELFDOSTPAYO"

  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
  Finding myself in honour so forbid,
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
  Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
  And never see day that the happy sees,
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.


MMDCLXXXV - "HOWIFAINTWHENI"

  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
  Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
  A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
  If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
  Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
  Is this the man that you did tell us of?


MMDCLXXXVI - "OFYOUDOWRITEKN"

  Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
  Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
  You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  I would have had thee there, and here again,
  Together with the terror of the place,--
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.


MMDCLXXXVII - "OWINGABETTERSP"

  O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
  With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
  As doth the fury of two desperate men
  But you must join in souls to mock me too?
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
  Present. Why should I carry lies abroad?


MMDCLXXXVIII - "IRITDOTHUSEYOU"

  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
  To one so meek, that mine own servant should
  Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  The great contention of the sea and skies
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.


MMDCLXXXIX - "RNAMEANDINTHEP"

  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
  My royal father, cheer these noble lords
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  And go indeed, having so good a mean.
  Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
  Dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
  I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
  Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
  To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
  Hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!


MMDCXC - "RAISETHEREOFSP"

  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
  If Henry were recall'd to life again,
  So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  To dispossess that child which is not his?
  His wish'd ability, he had himself
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  O heavy times, begetting such events!
  Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
  She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.


MMDCXCI - "ENDSALLHISMIGH"

  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
  Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
  Summon their general unto the wall.
  A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
  Let him have all the rigor of the law.
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  God forbid any malice should prevail,
  How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?


MMDCXCII - "TTOMAKEMETONGU"

  Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
  That shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  As broken glass no cement can redress,
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Than is her custom: it is still her use
  Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Upon my head and all this famous land.


MMDCXCIII - "ETIEDSPEAKINGO"

  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  The life, the right and truth of all this realm
  If they surcease to be that should survive.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  And your lips too; for I am well assured
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
  Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
  Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.


MMDCXCIV - "FYOURFAMEBUTSI"

  For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
  You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
  Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
  For stones dissolved to water do convert.
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
  I am not bid to wait upon this bride.


MMDCXCV - "NCEYOURWORTHWI"

  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
  Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
  I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.


MMDCXCVI - "DEASTHEOCEANIS"

  Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
  Such is the lightness of you common men.
  Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
  Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
  Could all my travels warrant me they live.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.
  If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.


MMDCXCVII - "THEHUMBLEASTHE"

  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
  Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
  Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMDCXCVIII - "PROUDESTSAILDO"

  Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
  Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.
  So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
  As modest stillness and humility:
  I heard no letter from my master since
  Leave off discourse of disability:
  Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.


MMDCXCIX - "THBEARMYSAUCYB"

  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  But this effusion of such manly drops,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
  Your French heart, I will be glad to hear you
  Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.


MMDCC - "ARKINFERIORFAR"

  Arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
  On special dignities, which vacant lie
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
  And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


MMDCCI - "TOHISONYOURBRO"

  The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
  Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
  I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
  Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
  O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
  Upon your oath of service to the pope,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  But, being moody, give him line and scope
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!


MMDCCII - "ADMAINDOTHWILF"

  Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Make choice of which your highness will see first.
  And oftentimes excusing of a fault
  I must be cruel, only to be kind;
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Than I am able to instruct or teach:
  Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
  What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
  I have no great devotion to the deed;
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  For men to see, and seeing wonder at.


MMDCCIII - "ULLYAPPEARYOUR"

  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
  Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
  You knew my father well, and in him me,
  As willingly do I the same resign
  Proving from world's minority their right:
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  And live a coward in thine own esteem,
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMDCCIV - "SHALLOWESTHELP"

  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Let God for ever keep it from my head,
  Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.


MMDCCV - "WILLHOLDMEUPAF"

  Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
  It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
  Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
  Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
  Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
  Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Until the golden circuit on my head,
  Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
  And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
  Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.


MMDCCVI - "LOATWHILSTHEUP"

  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Punish my life for tainting of my love!


MMDCCVII - "ONYOURSOUNDLES"

  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
  Of all the court and princes of my blood:
  Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
  Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
  Should so with civil and uncivil arms
  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
  None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?


MMDCCVIII - "SDEEPDOTHRIDEO"

  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  That for thyself: I will not so presume
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  Rot and consume themselves in little time.
  If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?


MMDCCIX - "RBEINGWRECKDIA"

  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
  Not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
  God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
  Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.


MMDCCX - "MAWORTHLESSBOA"

  My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
  And to commend their service to his will.
  We speak no treason, man: we say the king
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!
  Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
  Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
  Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  See what a grace was seated on this brow;
  Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!


MMDCCXI - "THEOFTALLBUILD"

  The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
  Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
  From me by strong assault it is bereft.
  Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:
  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
  By any indirection: I did send
  Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
  I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!


MMDCCXII - "INGANDOFGOODLY"

  Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
  Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
  You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!


MMDCCXIII - "PRIDETHENIFHET"

  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  I do embrace your offer; and dispose
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
  I guess one angel in another's hell;
  Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
  Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?


MMDCCXIV - "HRIVEANDIBECAS"

  Have been beholding to him in his life;
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  It tutors nature: artificial strife
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
  But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
  A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
  Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?


MMDCCXV - "TAWAYTHEWORSTW"

  The enemy of all your graces lives.
  And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
  When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
  And then betwixt me and my married wife.
  You have no stomach having broke your fast;
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  Will bring this labour to an happy end.
  Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  She that in wisdom never was so frail
  That can I witness; and a fouler fact
  What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?


MMDCCXVI - "ASTHISMYLOVEWA"

  Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  To draw conditions of a friendly peace;
  Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
  In the contempt and anger of his lip!
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
  Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  When I against myself with thee partake?
  All this away and me most wretched make.


MMDCCXVII - "SMYDECAYORISHA"

  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
  May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
  Your master will be dead ere you return;
  Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
  And that you not delay the present, but,
  You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  It's fit it should be so; for princes are
  So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
  Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
  And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?


MMDCCXVIII - "LLLIVEYOUREPIT"

  Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
  Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  You do impeach your modesty too much,
  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
  The King your father is dispos'd to sleep.


MMDCCXIX - "APHTOMAKEORYOU"

  As very infants prattle of thy pride.
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
  That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
  Or as tie heresies that men do leave
  Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
  Are hated most of those they did deceive,
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


MMDCCXX - "SURVIVEWHENIIN"

  So many blows upon this face of mine,
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Insulting tyranny begins to jet
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
  He that shall live this day, and see old age,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
  It was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!


MMDCCXXI - "EARTHAMROTTENF"

  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  The yearly course that brings this day about
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  And his enforcement of the city wives;
  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
  Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
  For wise men say it is the wisest course.


MMDCCXXII - "ROMHENCEYOURME"

  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
  Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.
  Of their disguising and pretended flight;
  Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
  Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
  Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MMDCCXXIII - "MORYDEATHCANNO"

  Might there not be a charity in sin
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.
  Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
  A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
  No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.


MMDCCXXIV - "TTAKEALTHOUGHI"

  To keep the oath that we administer:
  Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
  An angry arm against His minister.
  Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  And little stars shot from their fixed places,
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  The one and other Diomed embraces.
  Hast the harvest out of thine own report.
  Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  He slily stole away and left his men:
  I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.


MMDCCXXV - "NMEEACHPARTWIL"

  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
  Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
  And age in love loves not to have years told:
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
  To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
  Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Let me my service tender on your lips.


MMDCCXXVI - "LBEFORGOTTENYO"

  Labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
  By this, starts Collatine as from a dream,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  For my respects are better than they seem
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  God knows how long it is I have to live;
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  The wager thou hast won; and I will add
  Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!


MMDCCXXVII - "URNAMEFROMHENC"

  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  An old man, broken with the storms of state,
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
  My marvel and my message. To your court
  Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.


MMDCCXXVIII - "EIMMORTALLIFES"

  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Is not amiss when it is truly done,
  Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.
  Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
  Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
  A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
  Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
  Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
  If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
  Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!


MMDCCXXIX - "HALLHAVETHOUGH"

  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  How many days will finish up the year;
  And about evening come yourself alone
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
  Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  How like the empress and her sons you are!


MMDCCXXX - "IONCEGONETOALL"

  I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
  Other offenders we will pause upon.
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.


MMDCCXXXI - "THEWORLDMUSTDI"

  That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
  He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  Do not abuse my master's bounty by
  Is his to use, so Somerset may die.


MMDCCXXXII - "ETHEEARTHCANYI"

  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  This fair alliance quickly shall call home
  Hath to the marbled mansion all above
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
  Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
  Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
  Are they not now upon the western shore.
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.


MMDCCXXXIII - "ELDMEBUTACOMMO"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  By having him, making yourself no less.
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess,--
  As she had made the overture, she ceased
  Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
  O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
  Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
  My remedy is then to pluck it out.
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!


MMDCCXXXIV - "NGRAVEWHENYOUE"

  Not Erebus itself were dim enough
  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMDCCXXXV - "NTOMBEDINMENSE"

  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  To show how quaint an orator you are:
  O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
  My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
  Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
  My lord's almost so far transported that
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMDCCXXXVI - "YESSHALLLIEYOU"

  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  And with a larger tether may he walk
  Led hither by pure love: which of them both
  Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
  Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
  I do extend him, sir, within himself,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  You make strong party, or defend yourself
  Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?


MMDCCXXXVII - "RMONUMENTSHALL"

  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  My lord's almost so far transported that
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
  So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  And bear the palm for having bravely shed
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.


MMDCCXXXVIII - "BEMYGENTLEVERS"

  By custom and the ordinance of times
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
  You four, from hence to prison back again;
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  Not measuring what use we made of them.
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.


MMDCCXXXIX - "EWHICHEYESNOTY"

  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  It is not for your health thus to commit
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  His insolence draws folly from my lips;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
  You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.


MMDCCXL - "ETCREATEDSHALL"

  Else with the like I had requited him.
  There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
  Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
  A just and open trial. While she lives
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Left there round turrets destitute and pale.


MMDCCXLI - "OERREADANDTONG"

  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
  Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
  And each one to his office when he wakes.
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  O masters, if I were disposed to stir
  No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
  Go thou, and fill another room in hell.


MMDCCXLII - "UESTOBEYOURBEI"

  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  She will be sick else. This day, no man think
  Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  Of disobedient opposition
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.


MMDCCXLIII - "NGSHALLREHEARS"

  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  And often at his very loose decides
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!


MMDCCXLIV - "EWHENALLTHEBRE"

  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
  Have I not here the best cards for the game,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
  The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMDCCXLV - "ATHERSOFTHISWO"

  All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,
  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
  His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  The poor mechanic porters crowding in
  How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
  I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
  Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
  O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!


MMDCCXLVI - "RLDAREDEADYOUS"

  Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
  And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
  Regard thy danger, and along with me!
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  And then he drew a dial from his poke,
  Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Seven? why, there were but four even now.


MMDCCXLVII - "TILLSHALLLIVES"

  That I no more can see what once I was!
  I would not spare my brother in this case,
  Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
  Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
  Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  And useth it to patronage his theft.
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.


MMDCCXLVIII - "UCHVIRTUEHATHM"

  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
  And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.
  Then 'tis but reason that I be released
  He is their god: he leads them like a thing
  Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.


MMDCCXLIX - "YPENWHEREBREAT"

  Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
  Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  Without annoying me: and there were drawn
  He hath a tear for pity and a hand
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  By me invested, he compeers the best.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  And lastly, to confirm that amity
  To bear the tidings of calamity.


MMDCCL - "HMOSTBREATHESE"

  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
  But now the substance shall endure the like,
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  And if King Edward be as true and just
  Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMDCCLI - "VENINTHEMOUTHS"

  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
  Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
  Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
  Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!


MMDCCLII - "OFMENIGRANTTHO"

  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
  My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
  I would not be so sick though for his place:
  God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  And still it might, and yet it may again,
  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
  There is a tide in the affairs of men,
  To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
  Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!


MMDCCLIII - "UWERTNOTMARRIE"

  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Rain added to a river that is rank
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
  Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
  And batters down himself: what should I say?
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  I have the placing of the British crown.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMDCCLIV - "DTOMYMUSEANDTH"

  Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
  Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Many a battle have I won in France,
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
  Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  That taught his son the office of a fowl!
  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.


MMDCCLV - "EREFOREMAYSTWI"

  Exceed account; but the full sum of me
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  For in the temple by and by with us
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:
  And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
  You have a double tongue within your mask,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  The better that your lordship please to ask.
  What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
  Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!


MMDCCLVI - "THOUTATTAINTOE"

  Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
  He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
  Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
  Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
  The dearer by I know how much an ounce.
  And never shall you see that I will beg
  That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
  That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
  And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMDCCLVII - "RLOOKTHEDEDICA"

  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  How say you now? is not your husband mad?
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
  If he could burn us all into one coal,
  Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
  And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!


MMDCCLVIII - "TEDWORDSWHICHW"

  To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  Speak England first, that hath been forward first
  When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
  I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
  Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
  He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
  When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.


MMDCCLIX - "RITERSUSEOFTHE"

  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  Until thy head be circled with the same.
  Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
  For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  Here comes another troop to seek for you.
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MMDCCLX - "IRFAIRSUBJECTB"

  It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
  A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
  I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  But they will quake and tremble all this day.
  Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
  But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.


MMDCCLXI - "LESSINGEVERYBO"

  Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand
  Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
  Inferring arguments of mighty force.
  Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
  But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
  O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!


MMDCCLXII - "OKTHOUARTASFAI"

  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  That does infect the land: with which they moved
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
  So let it help me now against thy sword
  Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?


MMDCCLXIII - "RINKNOWLEDGEAS"

  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
  No, holy father; throw away that thought;
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  O my dear father, restoration hang
  Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Do shameful execution on herself.
  Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  And all the fertile land within that bound,
  So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.


MMDCCLXIV - "INHUEFINDINGTH"

  I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
  No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
  Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
  Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
  Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
  No; for he could not so resign his crown
  Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.


MMDCCLXV - "YWORTHALIMITPA"

  You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
  Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
  Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
  Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
  As those that I am come to tell you of!
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
  Myself and what is mine to you and yours
  I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
  To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
  Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
  And make it but a shadow, as I am.


MMDCCLXVI - "STMYPRAISEANDT"

  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
  The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
  Making another head to fight again.
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
  I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
  Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Absolute madness could so far have raved
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Did he so often lodge in open field,
  That England shall couch down in fear and yield.


MMDCCLXVII - "HEREFOREARTENF"

  Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  And by and by I will to thee appear.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  That highly may advantage thee to hear:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
  For thou art all, and all things else are thine.


MMDCCLXVIII - "ORCEDTOSEEKANE"

  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
  That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
  Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,
  Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMDCCLXIX - "WSOMEFRESHERST"

  Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
  Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  For as the sun is daily new and old,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Such sweet observance in this work was had,
  Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.


MMDCCLXX - "AMPOFTHETIMEBE"

  As my ripe revenue and due by birth
  Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
  Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?
  For Adon's sake, a youngster proud and wild;
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Many a morning hath he there been seen,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMDCCLXXI - "TTERINGDAYSAND"

  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  The sharded beetle in a safer hold
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  I see, as in a map, the end of all.
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
  Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
  Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?


MMDCCLXXII - "DOSOLOVEYETWHE"

  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
  So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
  O, how I faint when I of you do write,
  Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
  O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Your brother and his lover have embraced:
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
  Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
  Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMDCCLXXIII - "NTHEYHAVEDEVIS"

  Now present here together: that's to say,
  That wait for execution in the morn.
  Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Your highness came to England, so will I
  Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
  And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  I was of late as petty to his ends
  Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?


MMDCCLXXIV - "EDWHATSTRAINED"

  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
  He had no legs that practis'd not his gait;
  An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
  The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
  Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  And to your quick-conceiving discontents
  I can no other answer make but thanks,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Dim register and notary of shame!


MMDCCLXXV - "TOUCHESRHETORI"

  The current that with gentle murmur glides,
  O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  That tremble at the imagination?
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.


MMDCCLXXVI - "CCANLENDTHOUTR"

  Contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
  Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
  Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
  High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Under whose colours he had fought so long.
  To make commotion, as full well he can,
  Retain but privilege of a private man?


MMDCCLXXVII - "ULYFAIRWERTTRU"

  Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
  Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  And vows revenge as spacious as between
  I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  The baby figure of the giant mass
  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
  Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!


MMDCCLXXVIII - "LYSYMPATHIZEDI"

  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
  See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
  Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
  And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
  The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
  Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
  I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
  Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.


MMDCCLXXIX - "NTRUEPLAINWORD"

  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  That policy may either last so long,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Under whose government come they along?
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
  Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
  All you that see her, that she were a maid,
  It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?


MMDCCLXXX - "SBYTHYTRUETELL"

  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
  Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
  You know that I held Epicurus strong
  That tremble at the imagination?
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Like him that travels I return again,
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.


MMDCCLXXXI - "INGFRIENDANDTH"

  It will not be avoided but by this.
  Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  I think there is not half a kiss to choose
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  Drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
  To him that, for your honour and your state,
  How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!


MMDCCLXXXII - "EIRGROSSPAINTI"

  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
  She will not come; she bids you come to her.
  See what a grace was seated on this brow;
  Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
  And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
  If there be nothing new, but that which is
  Nor ask advice of any other thought
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
  Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.


MMDCCLXXXIII - "NGMIGHTBEBETTE"

  No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
  Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
  Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  Garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  To do him all the grace and good I could.
  Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
  Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMDCCLXXXIV - "RUSEDWHERECHEE"

  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  Which parti-coated presence of loose love
  He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMDCCLXXXV - "KSNEEDBLOODINT"

  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
  She is not fourteen. How long is it now
  Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  Behold another day break in the east:
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
  Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  To him that ever fears he shall be poor.


MMDCCLXXXVI - "HEEITISABUSEDI"

  Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  In me at once: but to the brightest beams
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  I have no joy of this contract to-night:
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  And for I know she taketh most delight
  Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  I have bethought me of another fault.


MMDCCLXXXVII - "NEVERSAWTHATYO"

  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
  And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
  Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
  That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  All the occurrence of my fortune since
  The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.


MMDCCLXXXVIII - "UDIDPAINTINGNE"

  Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
  Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
  Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
  And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
  I would the state of time had first been whole
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  That could be moved to smile at any thing.
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMDCCLXXXIX - "EDANDTHEREFORE"

  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  Throttle their practised accent in their fears
  He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MMDCCXC - "TOYOURFAIRNOPA"

  To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  You have your wish; my will is even this:
  O sacred receptacle of my joys,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
  As after some oration fairly spoke
  If they'll do neither, we will come to them,
  Remember so weak a composition.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Of disobedient opposition
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!


MMDCCXCI - "INTINGSETIFOUN"

  I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
  Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
  Score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
  Even for this let us divided live,
  The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  For thou art not so long by the head as
  Of dire combustion and confused events
  Unto the citizens, who haply may
  No, madam; we will bring you on your way.


MMDCCXCII - "DORTHOUGHTIFOU"

  Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
  Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
  Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
  Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  I have a letter guessingly set down,
  Found his deserts: how innocent I was
  On either side I come to spend my breath;
  Until they hear the order of his death.


MMDCCXCIII - "NDYOUDIDEXCEED"

  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
  Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
  I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
  Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
 eXpose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Defiance to the traitor, and so die?


MMDCCXCIV - "THEBARRENTENDE"

  That with the king here resteth in his tent?
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  But that I did proceed upon just grounds
  And were I any thing but what I am,
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
  Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMDCCXCV - "ROFAPOETSDEBTA"

  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
  And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
  Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
  They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
  And lowly words were ransom for their fault.


MMDCCXCVI - "NDTHEREFOREHAV"

  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
  How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Her aid she promised and assured success:
  All my abilities in thy behalf.
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MMDCCXCVII - "EISLEPTINYOURR"

  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  That it had it head bit off by it young.
  I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  You find him like a soldier: do not take
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Rot and consume themselves in little time.


MMDCCXCVIII - "EPORTTHATYOUYO"

  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!
  Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  You tread upon my patience: but be sure
  O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?


MMDCCXCIX - "URSELFBEINGEXT"

  Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
  For in a minute there are many days:
  But rather one that smiles and still invites
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  I think his understanding is bereft.
  No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
  Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
 eXcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.


MMDCCC - "ANTWELLMIGHTSH"

  Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  That nightly lie in those unproper beds
  Will or exceed the common or be caught
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  More honourable state, more courtship lives
  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  This is an accident of hourly proof,
  Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is King;
  He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.


MMDCCCI - "OWHOWFARAMODER"

  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
  Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
  Honour and virtue and conversed with such
  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  We shall not find like opportunity.
  Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
  And make me happy in your unity.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.


MMDCCCII - "NQUILLDOTHCOME"

  Next, if I be appointed for the place,
  Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  If ever you have look'd on better days,
  Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
  O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
  The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
  My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMDCCCIII - "TOOSHORTSPEAKI"

  Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
  Should many people, under two commands,
  His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  This world to me is like a lasting storm,
  Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
  Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
  Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
  I fear I am not in my perfect mind.


MMDCCCIV - "NGOFWORTHWHATW"

  Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
  Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
  On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
  Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;
  Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
  Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
  Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,
  Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  And by the royalties of both your bloods,
  The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
  Was I a child to fear I know not what.


MMDCCCV - "ORTHINYOUDOTHG"

  O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  In sight of England and her lordly peers,
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Too little payment for so great a debt.
  How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
  Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?


MMDCCCVI - "ROWTHISSILENCE"

  Remember so weak a composition.
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
  Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
  I drink the air before me, and return
  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
  I' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  Even for this let us divided live,
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  Come all to help him, and so stop the air
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMDCCCVII - "FORMYSINYOUDID"

  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
  O, know he is the bridle of your will.
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  My love is as a fever, longing still
  Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
  Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?


MMDCCCVIII - "IMPUTEWHICHSHA"

  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
  My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
  Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  To play the broker in mine own behalf;
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  We do not act that often jest and laugh;
  He on her belly falls, she on her back.
  I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
  A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!


MMDCCCIX - "LLBEMOSTMYGLOR"

  Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
  Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,
  But did you never swear, and break an oath?
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  Means to immure herself and not be seen.
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MMDCCCX - "YBEINGDUMBFORI"

  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  In at his window; set this up with wax
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
  Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
  By many hands your father was subdued;
  For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
  O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.


MMDCCCXI - "IMPAIRNOTBEAUT"

  I have a letter guessingly set down,
  Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
  Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  I long to know the truth hereof at large.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
  Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
  Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  And how by this their child shall be advanced,
  Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
  Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!


MMDCCCXII - "YBEINGMUTEWHEN"

  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
  My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
  His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.


MMDCCCXIII - "OTHERSWOULDGIV"

  Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
  Threshold till my lord return from the wars.
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  With amplest entertainment: my free drift
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
  Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
  Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
  Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
  I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMDCCCXIV - "ELIFEANDBRINGA"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
  I can again thy former light restore,
  For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
  No longer session hold upon my shame,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  If I can catch him once upon the hip,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.


MMDCCCXV - "TOMBTHERELIVES"

  Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  More than the nature of a brother's love!
  But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  He used as creatures of another place
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.


MMDCCCXVI - "MORELIFEINONEO"

  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  For in this sin he is as deep as I.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  I from my mistress come to you in post;
  No; let my father seek another heir.
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.


MMDCCCXVII - "FYOURFAIREYEST"

  Fit to be made companion with a king:
  Yea the illiterate, that know not how
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  For stony limits cannot hold love out,
  And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,
  It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.


MMDCCCXVIII - "HANBOTHYOURPOE"

  His body to that pleasant country's earth,
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,
  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  The great assay of art; but at his touch--
  Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
  Your brother did employ my father much,--
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMDCCCXIX - "TSCANINPRAISED"

  The violence of either thee becomes,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
  And make it but a shadow, as I am.
  Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
  I am in parliament pledge for his truth
  Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
  Partly that I have need of such a youth
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  And speak between the change of man and boy
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?


MMDCCCXX - "EVISEWHOISITTH"

  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
  Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  It is impossible that ever Rome
  See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
  It follows then the cat must stay at home:
  The which shall turn you to no further harm
  The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!


MMDCCCXXI - "ATSAYSMOSTWHIC"

  As she had made the overture, she ceased
  Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Such are the poor, in health--or else a feast,
  And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
  See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  What incidency thou dost guess of harm
  He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
  I am appointed him to murder you.
  Come, let me see what task I have to do.


MMDCCCXXII - "HCANSAYMORETHA"

  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
  And reason flies the object of all harm:
  Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
  Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
  And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
  Yet have I gold flies from another coast;
  Make choice of which your highness will see first.
  Of what a monarchy you are the head:
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!


MMDCCCXXIII - "NTHISRICHPRAIS"

  Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
  Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
  Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
  I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
  Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
  I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
  Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?


MMDCCCXXIV - "ETHATYOUALONEA"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
  And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
  Of the most pious Edward with such grace
  Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
  And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
  Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.


MMDCCCXXV - "REYOUINWHOSECO"

  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Yet most suspected, as the time and place
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
  In him the painter labour'd with his skill
  Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
  What shall King Henry be a pupil still
  His subjects to oppression and contempt
  Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
  O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!


MMDCCCXXVI - "NFINEIMMUREDIS"

  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
  Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
  I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
  Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?


MMDCCCXXVII - "THESTOREWHICHS"

  This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
  Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
  It is the bloody business which informs
  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.


MMDCCCXXVIII - "HOULDEXAMPLEWH"

  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
  England and France might, through their amity,
 eXpose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  And thou art wedded to calamity.
  My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Who was by good appliance recovered.
  How easily murder is discovered!


MMDCCCXXIX - "EREYOUREQUALGR"

  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  You use her well: the world may laugh again;
  O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
  Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Am I the first that have been perjured so?
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.


MMDCCCXXX - "EWLEANPENURYWI"

  Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
  Witness these trenches made by grief and care,
  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
  No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Not so; but it hath been the longest night
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
  Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
  If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.


MMDCCCXXXI - "THINTHATPENDOT"

  Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  I fear I am attended by some spies.
  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
  His father revell'd in the heart of France,
  And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
  The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  Deny your asking: take your choice of those
  Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
  Than when you left him; even now he sung.


MMDCCCXXXII - "HDWELLTHATTOHI"

  Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!
  Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
  Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
  They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  I did not think the king so stored with friends.


MMDCCCXXXIII - "SSUBJECTLENDSN"

  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  So I return rebuked to my content
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent
  John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
  To make me slave to it; and for your sake
  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Nor would your noble mother for much more
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Neglect the visitation of my friends.


MMDCCCXXXIV - "OTSOMESMALLGLO"

  Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
  My purpose was not to have seen you here;
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  My lord, I have consider'd with myself
  As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
  Let them want nothing that my house affords.
  Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
  Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.


MMDCCCXXXV - "RYBUTHETHATWRI"

  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  You holy clergymen, is there no plot
  Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
  Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
  The purest spring is not so free from mud
  His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  To lay his gay comparisons apart,
  Have I since your departure had, my lords.
  And module of confounded royalty.
  That in your country's service drew your swords:
  What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  If best were as it was, or best without.


MMDCCCXXXVI - "TESOFYOUIFHECA"

  To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  I think he be transform'd into a beast;
  For they that were your enemies are his,
  Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Come, come, you forward and unable worms!
  And thou hast given me most bitter terms.


MMDCCCXXXVII - "NTELLTHATYOUAR"

  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  That will I, for I must bear answer back
  Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
  And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
  To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
  Yet nature might have made me as these are,
  Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MMDCCCXXXVIII - "EYOUSODIGNIFIE"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Shall more attend upon the coming space,
  Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
  Do you your office, or give up your place,
  If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
  Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
  If he were living, I would try him yet.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMDCCCXXXIX - "SHISSTORYLETHI"

  So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
  She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
  Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
  The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  That so I may by this device at least
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.


MMDCCCXL - "MBUTCOPYWHATIN"

  Must these have voices, that can yield them now
  Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
  There comes the rain, there begins confusion.
  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
  Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  A most extracting frenzy of mine own
  To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  Neglect the visitation of my friends.


MMDCCCXLI - "YOUISWRITNOTMA"

  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
  Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  I tender so the safety of my liege.
  The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  To make a faithless error in your ears:
  My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
  And lay them gently on thy tender side.


MMDCCCXLII - "KINGWORSEWHATN"

  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
  One blushing shame, another white despair;
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
  This said, he sets his foot upon the light,
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.


MMDCCCXLIII - "ATUREMADESOCLE"

  A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
  The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  Make something nothing by augmenting it.
  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  Levy great sums of money through the realm
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.


MMDCCCXLIV - "ARANDSUCHACOUN"

  At your important letters,--this ill day
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  As thou art knight, never to disobey
  Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
  Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
  Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
  And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
  Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  Nothing in France, until he have no wife!


MMDCCCXLV - "TERPARTSHALLFA"

  Till of this flat a mountain you have made
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
  And the offender granted scope of speech,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  To do him wrong or any way impeach
  She did disdain my child, and stood between
  He has borne all things well: and I do think
  And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Led by a delicate and tender prince,
  For Richard, in the view of many lords,
  Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.


MMDCCCXLVI - "MEHISWITMAKING"

  Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,
  Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
  If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  My better angel is a man right fair,
  Are servanted to others: though I owe
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!


MMDCCCXLVII - "HISSTYLEADMIRE"

  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  You follow the young Prince up and down, like
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
  If she be in her chamber or your house,
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMDCCCXLVIII - "DEVERYWHEREYOU"

  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
  Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
  He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
  Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!


MMDCCCXLIX - "TOYOURBEAUTEOU"

  To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
  O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
  Undoing all, as all had never been!


MMDCCCL - "SBLESSINGSADDA"

  Should of another therefore be abused!
  But with a baser man of arms by far
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Descended of so many royal kings.
  As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.


MMDCCCLI - "CURSEBEINGFOND"

  Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
  Unless it be to think that she is by
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.


MMDCCCLII - "ONPRAISEWHICHM"

  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
  I must not yield to any rites of love,
  Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
  He, spying her, bounced in, whereas he stood:
  I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
  Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
  My very worthy cousin, fairly met!


MMDCCCLIII - "AKESYOURPRAISE"

  A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
  Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  And is become the bellows and the fan
  I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
  Still and contemplative in living art.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMDCCCLIV - "SWORSEMYTONGUE"

  So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
  Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  Or more than any living man could bear.
  Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
  Give me some sack; and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
  Under your pardon. You must note beside,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MMDCCCLV - "TIEDMUSEINMANN"

  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
  If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Now where is he that will not stay so long
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MMDCCCLVI - "ERSHOLDSHERSTI"

  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
  He talks to me that never had a son.
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
  I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.


MMDCCCLVII - "LLWHILECOMMENT"

  Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
  We will persuade him, be it possible,
  He rush'd into my house and took perforce
  Is it not well? What should you need of more?
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
  This evening, on the east side of the grove.


MMDCCCLVIII - "SOFYOURPRAISER"

  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
  For man or master. Then it follows thus:
  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
  O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Put this in any liquid thing you will,
  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  And useless barns the harvest of his wits;
  I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.


MMDCCCLIX - "ICHLYCOMPILEDR"

  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  Can ransom me into his love again,
  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
  Plead my successive title with your swords:
  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
  Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


MMDCCCLX - "ESERVETHEIRCHA"

  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Canonized and worshipped as a saint,
  Her father is no better than an earl,
  And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!


MMDCCCLXI - "RACTERWITHGOLD"

  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  And, after conflict such as was supposed
  Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
  That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
  Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
  To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
  Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
  Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.


MMDCCCLXII - "ENQUILLANDPREC"

  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  Queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
  Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
  Prepare the body then, and follow us.
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.


MMDCCCLXIII - "IOUSPHRASEBYAL"

  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  So many days my ewes have been with young;
  Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  By staying there so long till all were lost.
  Younger than she are happy mothers made.
  And I shall find you empty of that fault,
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?


MMDCCCLXIV - "LTHEMUSESFILED"

  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
  For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
  I to myself am dearer than a friend,
  Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?


MMDCCCLXV - "ITHINKGOODTHOU"

  I would be so triumphant as I am?
  The why is plain as way to parish church:
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
  Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?


MMDCCCLXVI - "GHTSWHILSTOTHE"

  Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
  Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
  Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  When the intent of bearing them is just.
  He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
  In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Send her a story of thy noble acts;
  The confident and over-lusty French
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMDCCCLXVII - "RWRITEGOODWORD"

  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  The breath of worldly men cannot depose
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  We have record that very well it can,
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?


MMDCCCLXVIII - "SANDLIKEUNLETT"

  So that the art and practic part of life
  And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
  Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
  Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.


MMDCCCLXIX - "ERDCLERKSTILLC"

  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
  Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  To have her back return'd: thus to persist
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?


MMDCCCLXX - "RYAMENTOEVERYH"

  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
  Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
  Men at some time are masters of their fates:
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  You tender more your person's honour than
  Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.


MMDCCCLXXI - "YMNTHATABLESPI"

  You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
  Never to part with it; and here he stands;
  To use one language in each several clime
  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
  Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.
  A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
  By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Scorn and derision never come in tears:
  Partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
  Is it for him you do envy me so?


MMDCCCLXXII - "RITAFFORDSINPO"

  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
  I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
  There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
  And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
  For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
  For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
  O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  Searching the window for a flint, I found
  I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
  No man so potent breathes upon the ground
  Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!


MMDCCCLXXIII - "LISHDFORMOFWEL"

  Lesser his person than an ill report;
  I play the torturer, by small and small
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
  Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
  For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
  Walk under his huge legs and peep about
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.


MMDCCCLXXIV - "LREFINEDPENHEA"

  Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  For my profession's sacred from above:
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Dispersed are the glories it included.
  Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  And as he is, to witness this is true.


MMDCCCLXXV - "RINGYOUPRAISED"

  Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand
  I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  I have been begging sixteen years in court,
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Doth not the crown of England prove the king?


MMDCCCLXXVI - "ISAYTISSOTISTR"

  I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep
  Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
  And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
  Score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
  Small time, but in that small most greatly lived
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
  Rather than make unprofited return.


MMDCCCLXXVII - "UEANDTOTHEMOST"

  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
  Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
  Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
  There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
  Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  Suppose they take offence without a cause,
  Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?


MMDCCCLXXVIII - "OFPRAISEADDSOM"

  O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  And of so easy and so plain a stop
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
  Must he be then as shadow of himself?


MMDCCCLXXIX - "ETHINGMOREBUTT"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
  Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  But do not so; I love thee in such sort
  Unto the crown of France. That you may know
  Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
  This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.


MMDCCCLXXX - "HATISINMYTHOUG"

  How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
  And go well satisfied to France again.
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
  Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
  It was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
  You have no stomach having broke your fast;
  To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Good king, to be so mightily abused!


MMDCCCLXXXI - "HTWHOSELOVETOY"

  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
  So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Or, being open, put into his hands
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
  Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  You would not then have parted with the ring.


MMDCCCLXXXII - "OUTHOUGHWORDSC"

  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Under the service of a child as soon
  Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Of his bright passage to the occident.
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
  Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
  Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  Call for the music in the other room.


MMDCCCLXXXIII - "OMEHINDMOSTHOL"

  O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
  Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  Saving your merry humour, here's the note
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.


MMDCCCLXXXIV - "DSHISRANKBEFOR"

  Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
  Say what I think of it, since I have found
  Her face the book of praises, where is read
  In three divided; and his coffers sound
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
  Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
  O, that a mighty man of such descent,
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MMDCCCLXXXV - "ETHENOTHERSFOR"

  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  That you to-day promised to tell me of?
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
  Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,
  How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  For France, for France, for it is more than need.
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!


MMDCCCLXXXVI - "THEBREATHOFWOR"

  The king should keep his word in loving us;
  Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
  Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  For many years thought dead, are now revived,
  We may not think the justness of each act
  Old Helicanus goes along behind.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


MMDCCCLXXXVII - "DSRESPECTMEFOR"

  Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Set Caliban and his companions free;
  Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
  Exceed account; but the full sum of me
  Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
  Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
  Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
  Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!


MMDCCCLXXXVIII - "MYDUMBTHOUGHTS"

  My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
  You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
  Dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
  The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  O, never say that I was false of heart,
  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  Here she exclaims against repose and rest,
  They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
  Since they love men in arms as well as beds.


MMDCCCLXXXIX - "SPEAKINGINEFFE"

  Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
  Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  And will for evermore be true to it.
  Knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
  Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
  For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMDCCCXC - "CTWASITTHEPROU"

  Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  What things again most dear in the esteem
  A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  It shows my earnestness of affection-
  The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
  Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
  Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!


MMDCCCXCI - "DFULLSAILOFHIS"

  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
  Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
  Look that you take upon you as you should.
  Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
  If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
  Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
  Had not been here to dress the ugly form
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.


MMDCCCXCII - "GREATVERSEBOUN"

  Give me my principal, and let me go.
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  And let us once again assail your ears,
  Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?


MMDCCCXCIII - "DFORTHEPRIZEOF"

  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
  Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
  First he denied you had in him no right.


MMDCCCXCIV - "ALLTOOPRECIOUS"

  An onion will do well for such a shift,
  Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  To tread a measure with you on this grass.
  O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
  O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!
  Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
  I will the banner from a trumpet take,
  Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
  Unto the crown of France. That you may know
  Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?


MMDCCCXCV - "YOUTHATDIDMYRI"

  You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
  O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
  Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
  That my report is just and full of truth.
  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  Into the danger of this adverse town;
  Disguise us at my lodging and return,
  Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.


MMDCCCXCVI - "PETHOUGHTSINMY"

  Proffers his only daughter to your grace
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
  His deputy anointed in His sight,
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
  Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
  Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
  My speech should fall into such vile success
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.


MMDCCCXCVII - "BRAININHEARSEM"

  Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
  If best were as it was, or best without.
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  And for my sister and her princely sons,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.


MMDCCCXCVIII - "AKINGTHEIRTOMB"

  Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
  Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
  I guess one angel in another's hell:
  Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
  Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
  To use one language in each several clime
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  O, what a happy title do I find,
  My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
  Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.


MMDCCCXCIX - "THEWOMBWHEREIN"

  Think, being too strong for him, though he took
  How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  May be put from her by society:
  But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
  While she, the picture of pure piety,
  Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!


MMCM - "THEYGREWWASITH"

  The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
  Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
  Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
  And having that do choke their service up
  Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.


MMCMI - "ISSPIRITBYSPIR"

  I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
  Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
  Such danger to resistance did belong,
  Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
  If to have done the thing you gave in charge
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  I have inform'd his highness so at large
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
  Presents that I intend to send them both:
  I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.


MMCMII - "ITSTAUGHTTOWRI"

  I would the fool were married to her grave!
  That there's no maculation in thy heart:
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
  And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
  Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
  Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
  Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
  Of nature and of nations speak aloud
  With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.


MMCMIII - "TEABOVEAMORTAL"

  That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  And what God will, that let your king perform;
  But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  And six or seven winters more respect
  My father's purposes have been mistook;
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
  And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?


MMCMIV - "PITCHTHATSTRUC"

  Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
  In me at once: but to the brightest beams
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
  Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.
  And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
  Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  Thus will I fold them one on another:
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Under the moon, can save the thing from death
  Coming and going with thy honey breath.


MMCMV - "KMEDEADNONEITH"

  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  No more of him; for I will deal with him
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  That their negotiations all must slack,
  Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.


MMCMVI - "ERHENORHISCOMP"

  Even for this let us divided live,
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  How fine my master is! I am afraid
  I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!


MMCMVII - "EERSBYNIGHTGIV"

  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Such commendations as becomes a maid,
  But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
  Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
  No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
  Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
  Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
  In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
  Very hardly upon such a subject.


MMCMVIII - "INGHIMAIDMYVER"

  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
  Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
  Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
  If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
  Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
  Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
  My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
  Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!


MMCMIX - "SEASTONISHEDHE"

  So that but one heart we can make of it;
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
  Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
  Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MMCMX - "NORTHATAFFABLE"

  No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
  They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
  Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
  And stand indebted, over and above,
  Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
  All is the fear and nothing is the love;
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
  And make me as the poorest vassal is,
  Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!
  Let me give light, but let me not be light;
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMCMXI - "FAMILIARGHOSTW"

  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  I hold as little counsel with weak fear
  A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Grief best is pleased with grief's society:
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
  Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?


MMCMXII - "HICHNIGHTLYGUL"

  Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
  I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
  Come, side by side together live and die.
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  I have great hope in that; for in her youth
  God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
  Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.


MMCMXIII - "LSHIMWITHINTEL"

  Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
  Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
  I will stir up in England some black storm
  Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
  Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.


MMCMXIV - "LIGENCEASVICTO"

  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  I long with all my heart to see the prince:
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;
  Supposing it a thing impossible-
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  To do that office of thine own good will
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.


MMCMXV - "RSOFMYSILENCEC"

  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
  Or by the father there were none at all;
  Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
  Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
  Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!


MMCMXVI - "ANNOTBOASTIWAS"

  All kinds of arguments and question deep,
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
  On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
  That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
  By water shall he die, and take his end.
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
  Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
  With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.


MMCMXVII - "NOTSICKOFANYFE"

  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
  Of dire combustion and confused events
  There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
  And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
  Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
  For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMCMXVIII - "ARFROMTHENCEBU"

  All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
  Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
  Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Before this earthy prison of their bones;
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?


MMCMXIX - "TWHENYOURCOUNT"

  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
  Will creep in service where it cannot go.
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
  One of my fellows had the speed of him,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
  O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  There's reason he should be displeased at it.


MMCMXX - "ENANCEFILLDUPH"

  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  And dangerous success of bloody wars,
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
  I dreamt my master and another fought,
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
  Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.


MMCMXXI - "ISLINETHENLACK"

  If without peril it be possible,
  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
  Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
  Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
  He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,
  Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
  King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?


MMCMXXII - "DIMATTERTHATEN"

  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
  My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
  And when a soldier was the theme, my name
  The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
  To clear this spot by death, at least I give
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
  Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
  Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
  The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?


MMCMXXIII - "FEEBLEDMINEFAR"

  For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
  Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
  I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
  And nothing is at a like goodness still;
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


MMCMXXIV - "EWELLTHOUARTTO"

  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
  Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  At my depart, these were his very words:
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!


MMCMXXV - "ODEARFORMYPOSS"

  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Desire them an to my pavilion.
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  And fertile every wish, a million.
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
  Your sovereign greatness and authority.
  Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.


MMCMXXVI - "ESSINGANDLIKEE"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Still your own foes, deliver you as most
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  If you think meet, this afternoon will post
  Never so much as in a thought unborn
  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
  And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMCMXXVII - "NOUGHTHOUKNOWS"

  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
  Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
  Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.


MMCMXXVIII - "TTHYESTIMATETH"

  This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
  The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
  Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
  You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Stain'd with the variation of each soil
  That one for all, or all for one we gage;
  It seems then that the tidings of this broil
  Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
  And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  He shall be executed presently.


MMCMXXIX - "ECHARTEROFTHYW"

  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
  He hath a person and a smooth dispose
  And win them too: therefore let us devise
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  From him that fled some strange indignity,
  To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
  His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
  Your faithful service and your toil in war;
  Which I new pay as if not paid before.


MMCMXXX - "ORTHGIVESTHEER"

  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
  God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
  Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
  To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
  Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MMCMXXXI - "ELEASINGMYBOND"

  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
  Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
  It cannot be; some villains of my court
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Go with me; if you like upon report
  March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
  Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
  Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?


MMCMXXXII - "SINTHEEAREALLD"

  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.


MMCMXXXIII - "ETERMINATEFORH"

  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  To leave that latest which concerns him first,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
  Is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
  That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  False to his children or his wife's allies
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.


MMCMXXXIV - "OWDOIHOLDTHEEB"

  Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
  Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
  Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
  Here is a thing too young for such a place,
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.


MMCMXXXV - "UTBYTHYGRANTIN"

  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  The duke cannot deny the course of law:
  But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  This little abstract doth contain that large
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  Your gracious self to take on you the charge
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
  In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
  No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.


MMCMXXXVI - "GANDFORTHATRIC"

  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
  Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
  The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  It cannot be but he was murder'd here;
  Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.


MMCMXXXVII - "HESWHEREISMYDE"

  Had I it written, I would tear the word.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
  We know not where you left him all alive;
  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  If thou with Caesar paragon again
  Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
  Make us partakers of a little gain,
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
  Do more than counterpoise a full third part
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMCMXXXVIII - "SERVINGTHECAUS"

  She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
  Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
  That we must curb it upon others' proof;
  Her father and her country and her friends,
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Consider who the king your father sends,
  And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:
  Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
  So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.


MMCMXXXIX - "EOFTHISFAIRGIF"

  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  For so your doctors hold it very meet,
  To him and his usurp'd authority.
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  I am left out; for me nothing remains.
  So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
  Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
  And if thine eyes can water for his death,
  I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
  I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
  For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.


MMCMXL - "TINMEISWANTING"

  They call him Troilus, and on him erect
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  My army but a weak and sickly guard;
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  In this just suit come I to move your grace.
  So will the queen, that living held him dear.
  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
  And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
  Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
  Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
  Good parts did you first suffer love for me?


MMCMXLI - "ANDSOMYPATENTB"

  Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
  Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
  And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
  That Cupid will impose for my neglect
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
  But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.


MMCMXLII - "ACKAGAINISSWER"

  A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
  Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  And if the boy have not a woman's gift
  Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
  And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
  I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
  No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
  I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
  She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
  She modestly prepares to let them know
  Who is already sick and pale with grief,
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.


MMCMXLIII - "VINGTHYSELFTHO"

  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Give entertainment to the might of it,
  The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
  Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
  Your safety, for the which myself and them
  Send danger from the east unto the west,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
  To be commenced in strands afar remote.
  Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
  Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?


MMCMXLIV - "UGAVESTTHYOWNW"

  Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
  Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Since she is living, let the time run on
  To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
  Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
  Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
  You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
  Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
  Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  What, must I hold a candle to my shames?


MMCMXLV - "ORTHTHENNOTKNO"

  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  That doth sustain my house; you take my life
  He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
  To give this poor petition to the king,
  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Never so much as in a thought unborn
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  O hateful error, melancholy's child,
  The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.


MMCMXLVI - "WINGORMETOWHOM"

  Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
  Out, devil! I remember them too well:
  Were all thy children kind and natural!
  How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Misthink the king and not be satisfied!


MMCMXLVII - "THOUGAVESTITEL"

  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more
  Against the brows of this resisting town.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Thy will by my performance shall be served:
  In at his window; set this up with wax
  Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.


MMCMXLVIII - "SEMISTAKINGSOT"

  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Montano and myself being in speech,
  I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
  See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
  The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
  And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights,
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:
  Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
  Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
  Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
  Too early seen unknown, and known too late!


MMCMXLIX - "HYGREATGIFTUPO"

  Have broken with the king; who hath so far
  You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
  Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  And then against my heart he sets his sword,
  Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
  Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
  For terror, not to use, in time the rod
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
  Playing the place which did no form receive,
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.


MMCML - "NMISPRISIONGRO"

  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
  Match not the high perfection of my loss:
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  If in the child the father's image lies,
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  I bid them that did love their country's good
  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.


MMCMLI - "WINGCOMESHOMEA"

  Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
  Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
  O, you have lived in desolation here,
  My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
  O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
  May cement their divisions and bind up
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.


MMCMLII - "GAINONBETTERJU"

  Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
  And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
  I am left out; for me nothing remains.
  No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
  O, had the monster seen those lily hands
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
  This accident is not unlike my dream:
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
  Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!


MMCMLIII - "DGMENTMAKINGTH"

  Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
  Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  That scolds against the quality of flesh,
  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
  Knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
  In this the madman justly chargeth them.
  Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
  Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!


MMCMLIV - "USHAVEIHADTHEE"

  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
  Threw my affections in his charmed power,
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMCMLV - "ASADREAMDOTHFL"

  As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
  Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
  To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
  He has discover'd my design, and I
  From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
  Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?


MMCMLVI - "ATTERINSLEEPAK"

  At gaming, swearing, or about some act
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Lays open all the little worms that creep;
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
  As though she bid me stay by her a week;
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.


MMCMLVII - "INGBUTWAKINGNO"

  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
  Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
  Go with the princes, or stay here with us?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  The one and other Diomed embraces.
  Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
  And little stars shot from their fixed places,
  Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!


MMCMLVIII - "SUCHMATTERWHEN"

  She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
  He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
  My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
  And chastise with the valour of my tongue
  To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,
  The oldest have borne most; we that are young
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Why went you not with master doctor, maid?
  Hover about me with your airy wings
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.


MMCMLIX - "THOUSHALTBEDIS"

  Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
  Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
  But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
  So great a day as this is cheaply bought.


MMCMLX - "POSEDTOSETMELI"

  Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
  O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,
  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  That does infect the land: with which they moved
  Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
  See you the fornicatress be removed:
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
  My soul is full of discord and dismay.
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!


MMCMLXI - "GHTANDPLACEMYM"

  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
  And often at his very loose decides
  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
  Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
  Longer than I have time to tell his years!
  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
  Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
  You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
  My remedy is then to pluck it out.


MMCMLXII - "ERITINTHEEYEOF"

  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
  If he do break the smallest particle
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
  There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
  He lives that loves thee better than he could.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.


MMCMLXIII - "SCORNUPONTHYSI"

  So do each lord, and either greet him not,
  Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
  Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
  That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
  Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
  You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  I am ambitious for a motley coat.


MMCMLXIV - "DEAGAINSTMYSEL"

  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
  Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
  And fits the mounting spirit like myself,
  If he be credulous and trust my tale,
  Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
  Swear in both the scales against either scale;
  That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
  My soul and body to the skies and ground;
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Say what I think of it, since I have found
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.


MMCMLXV - "FILLFIGHTANDPR"

  Friend and companion in the front of war,
  Is not inured; return again in haste;
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
  In howling wise, to see my doleful plight.
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
  Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
  And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
  Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.


MMCMLXVI - "OVETHEEVIRTUOU"

  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
  He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  It may be good: pride hath no other glass
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  That I may see my shadow as I pass.
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?


MMCMLXVII - "STHOUGHTHOUART"

  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
  His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
  Or else return no more into my sight.
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  And by the benefit of his wished light,
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
  The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!


MMCMLXVIII - "FORSWORNWITHMI"

  Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
  O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
  Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
  I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  To eke it and to draw it out in length,
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
  I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.


MMCMLXIX - "NEOWNWEAKNESSB"

  Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
  Why would he for the momentary trick
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  As well as I am doubtless I can purge
  Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Environed with a wilderness of sea,
  So should my papers yellow'd with their age
  Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
  Be you and I behind an arras then.


MMCMLXX - "EINGBESTACQUAI"

  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  If haply you my father do suspect
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
  Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  And by and by thy bosom shall partake
  Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
  Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
  Unless thou let his silver water keep
  And am not I a prelate of the church?
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.


MMCMLXXI - "NTEDUPONTHYPAR"

  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Unless he live until he be a man.
  Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
  Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
  And make a riot on the gentle brow
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMCMLXXII - "TICANSETDOWNAS"

  These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
  Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
  Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
  Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
  She shall be married to this noble earl.


MMCMLXXIII - "TORYOFFAULTSCO"

  That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
  Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  The strongest body shall it make most weak,
  Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
  Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MMCMLXXIV - "NCEALDWHEREINI"

  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  And by her fair immortal hand she swears,
  Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
  Deliver him to safety; and return,
  Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
  Nor the division of a battle knows
  I know the man. What is the sum he owes?


MMCMLXXV - "AMATTAINTEDTHA"

  As well appeareth by the cause you come;
  My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
  Another, with his finger and his thumb,
  The sun will set before I shall discharge
  That holds this present question in the court?
  And creep into it far before thy time?
  If Warwick be so near as men report.
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
  Hath set the women on to this complaint:
  And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.


MMCMLXXVI - "TTHOUINLOSINGM"

  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
  There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
  Into the channel, till the lowest stream
  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
  My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!


MMCMLXXVII - "ESHALTWINMUCHG"

  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
  Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
  And in a bloody battle end thy days!
  Let York be regent; I will yield to him.
  Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
  Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
  More than light airs and recollected terms
  Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
  Come, come, you forward and unable worms!
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.


MMCMLXXVIII - "LORYANDIBYTHIS"

  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
  Against my love shall be, as I am now,
  Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
  Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
  If with the sap of reason you would quench,
  But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  I have it ready for thee; here it is.
  Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.


MMCMLXXIX - "WILLBEAGAINERT"

  Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
  I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
  But with a grain a day, I would not buy
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  A visor for a visor! what care I
  Give me the paper; let me read the same;
  And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
  I am a feather for each wind that blows:
  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  That since have felt the vigour of his rage.


MMCMLXXX - "OOFORBENDINGAL"

  O, when the King did throw his warder down--
  Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
  Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
  Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  And, commendable proved, let's die in pride.
  Lord of thy presence and no land beside?


MMCMLXXXI - "LMYLOVINGTHOUG"

  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  More bright in zeal than the devotion which
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
  Not all these lords do vex me half so much
  Give even way unto my rough affairs;
  The day is broke; be wary, look about.
  Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
  Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?


MMCMLXXXII - "HTSONTHEETHEIN"

  Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
  That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
  She treads the path that she untreads again;
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
  His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.


MMCMLXXXIII - "JURIESTHATTOMY"

  Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
  That she is busy and she cannot come.
  He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
  And, like her true nobility, she has
  Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.


MMCMLXXXIV - "SELFIDODOINGTH"

  Seeming and savour all the winter long:
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
  For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
  I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
  Do in his name religiously demand
  Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
  Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
  Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
  Into a cloven pine; within which rift
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.


MMCMLXXXV - "EEVANTAGEDOUBL"

  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
  Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
  That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
  About it; for it stands me much upon,
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
  Of that great shadow I did represent;
  Unless some dull and favourable hand
  Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
  Let all of his complexion choose me so.


MMCMLXXXVI - "EVANTAGEMESUCH"

  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
  The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
  And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
  Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
  Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
  Consisting equally of horse and foot;
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?


MMCMLXXXVII - "ISMYLOVETOTHEE"

  If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
  So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
  Might be affronted with the match and weight
  Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
  Let me give light, but let me not be light;
  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
  To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
  His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.


MMCMLXXXVIII - "ISOBELONGTHATF"

  I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
  To make a shaking fever in your walls,
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
  And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  For our beloved mother in her pains.


MMCMLXXXIX - "ORTHYRIGHTMYSE"

  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
  Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
  Go with the princes, or stay here with us?
  He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
  Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,
  Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMCMXC - "LFWILLBEARALLW"

  Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
  Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
  Borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  And in this private plot be we the first
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Legitimation, name and all is gone:
  Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?


MMCMXCI - "RONGSAYTHATTHO"

  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
  Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
  And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
  Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
  Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
  Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  The extreme parts of time extremely forms
  Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.


MMCMXCII - "UDIDSTFORSAKEM"

  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
  Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
  It is thy business that I go about.
  Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.
  Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
  To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
  Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  And on a safer judgment all revoke
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  My health and happy being at your court.


MMCMXCIII - "EFORSOMEFAULTA"

  Even for revenge mock my destruction!
  Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
  Of thy intents desires instruction,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
  Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
  And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
  Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
  And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.


MMCMXCIV - "NDIWILLCOMMENT"

  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
  Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
  I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
  Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
  Or have we eaten on the insane root
  More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Their own enactures with themselves destroy.


MMCMXCV - "UPONTHATOFFENC"

  Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
  Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;
  Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
  And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;
  That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.


MMCMXCVI - "ESPEAKOFMYLAME"

  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
  From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,
  My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
  Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
  My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MMCMXCVII - "NESSANDISTRAIG"

  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
  Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
  And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  If it conceived a male child by me, should
  Suppose they take offence without a cause,
  That very envy and the tongue of loss
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  I am content, in a good father's care,
  Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!


MMCMXCVIII - "HTWILLHALTAGAI"

  Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.
  Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
  Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
  I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  He hath a garden circummured with brick,
  And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
  Like men born to renown by life or death.
  That like a football you do spurn me thus?
  And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
  Go with the princes, or stay here with us?
  And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
  I would be so triumphant as I am?


MMCMXCIX - "NSTTHYREASONSM"

  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
  Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
  The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
  How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  And darkness be the burier of the dead!
  Swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
  Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
  No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
  My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.


MMM - "AKINGNODEFENCE"

  Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
  I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:
  Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
  O, teach me how you look, and with what art
  Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Found that the issue was not his begot;
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMI - "THOUCANSTNOTLO"

  Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
  Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
  Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,
  Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
  Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  The man that hath no music in himself,
  No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
  Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
  This but begins the woe, others must end.
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.


MMMII - "VEDISGRACEMEHA"

  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  In no less working than are swords and bows
  So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;
  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
  Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  And let her head fall into England's lap.


MMMIII - "LFSOILLTOSETAF"

  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
  She was a vixen when she went to school;
  One that still motions war and never peace,
  If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  To hold your honour more precise and nice
  And dangerous success of bloody wars,
  For ever and for ever shall be yours.


MMMIV - "ORMUPONDESIRED"

  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
  Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Saving your merry humour, here's the note
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?


MMMV - "CHANGEASILLMYS"

  Coming from thee, I could not put him back,
  He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  Good time of day unto your royal grace!
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  I am a tainted wether of the flock,
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
  Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
  So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.


MMMVI - "ELFDISGRACEKNO"

  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
  For I should melt at an offender's tears,
  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  I will, if that my fading breath permit
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  God pardon them that are the cause of it!
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
  Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!


MMMVII - "WINGTHYWILLIWI"

  With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
  I do embrace your offer; and dispose
  Not working with the eye without the ear,
  Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
  The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
  Within the guilty closure of thy walls
  I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  When you have pushed out your gates the very
  I have a king's oath to the contrary.


MMMVIII - "LLACQUAINTANCE"

  Let us sway on and face them in the field.
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  And the device he bears upon his shield
  Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
  Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
  And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
  No, no; he cannot long hold out these pangs.
  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MMMIX - "STRANGLEANDLOO"

  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:
  That, from the sense of all civility,
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  As modest stillness and humility:
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
  O, torture me no more! I will confess.


MMMX - "KSTRANGEBEABSE"

  Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  A beast, to bear every knave's wrong.
  Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
  Send for the county; go tell him of this:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MMMXI - "NTFROMTHYWALKS"

  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
  Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
  And never shall have length of life enough
  Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.


MMMXII - "ANDINMYTONGUET"

  A private whisper, no, not with such friends
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
  You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
  This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
  Of his bright passage to the occident.
  Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
  God hold it, to your honour's good content!
  Unless she do it under this excuse,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.


MMMXIII - "HYSWEETBELOVED"

  Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
  You stand within his danger, do you not?
  Shall secretly into the bosom creep
  When this same lusty gentleman was got.
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
  Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.


MMMXIV - "NAMENOMORESHAL"

  Now do I long to hear how you were found;
  And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
  My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
  Of either's colour was the other queen,
  My strength can give you: then no more remains,
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Happy were England, would this gracious prince
  As the death-bed whereon it must expire
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.


MMMXV - "LDWELLLESTITOO"

  Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  When the intent of bearing them is just.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
  Like little body with a mighty heart,
  Let us withdraw into the other room.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  That speak my salutation in their minds;
  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
  To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
  Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
  Or else he never would compare between.


MMMXVI - "MUCHPROFANESHO"

  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
  Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,
  How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
  Praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
  And was my own fee-simple, not in part,
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
  Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
  Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.


MMMXVII - "ULDDOITWRONGAN"

  Unto your Grace do I in chief address
  Love loving not itself none other can.
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
  O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
  They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
  Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
  Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.


MMMXVIII - "DHAPLYOFOUROLD"

  Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
  Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
  As modest stillness and humility:
  Put this in any liquid thing you will,
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
  Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
  For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
  Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
  Love make your fortunes twenty times above
  Do all men kill the things they do not love?


MMMXIX - "ACQUAINTANCETE"

  Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
  Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
  Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  To business with the King, more than the scope
  And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  That you should seal this lawless bloody book
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.


MMMXX - "LLFORTHEEAGAIN"

  Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
  Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  And so, conduct me where, from company,
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?


MMMXXI - "STMYSELFILLVOW"

  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  Mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
  For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
  If he could burn us all into one coal,
  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
  When I against myself with thee partake?


MMMXXII - "DEBATEFORIMUST"

  Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  By innocence I swear, and by my youth
  As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
  To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.


MMMXXIII - "NEERLOVEHIMWHO"

  Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  I will be master of what is mine own-
  Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
  Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
  Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
  O polish'd perturbation! golden care!


MMMXXIV - "MTHOUDOSTHATET"

  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
  Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
  And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
  Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Threshold till my lord return from the wars.


MMMXXV - "HENHATEMEWHENT"

  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  How long is't now since last yourself and I
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  The king and his companions: warily
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  With words that in an honest suit might move.
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Never did captive with a freer heart
  The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.


MMMXXVI - "HOUWILTIFEVERN"

  He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.


MMMXXVII - "OWNOWWHILETHEW"

  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
  Nay, he must bear you company. The king
  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
  Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
  He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
  Instructed by the antiquary times,
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
  How shall that faith return again to earth,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.


MMMXXVIII - "ORLDISBENTMYDE"

  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
  Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
  You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
  Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMXXIX - "EDSTOCROSSJOIN"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  So much I challenge that I may profess
  That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
  Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
  Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
  O, two such silver currents, when they join,
  Is all the policy, strength and defence,
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.


MMMXXX - "WITHTHESPITEOF"

  Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
  Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
  That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
  He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
  That day that made my sister thirteen years.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.


MMMXXXI - "FORTUNEMAKEMEB"

  Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
  O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  That ever was survey'd by English eye,
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
  And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  England, bound in with the triumphant sea
  But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.


MMMXXXII - "OWANDDONOTDROP"

  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.


MMMXXXIII - "INFORANAFTERLO"

  In me at once: but to the brightest beams
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
  O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
  For such disguise as haply shall become
  To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.


MMMXXXIV - "SSAHDONOTWHENM"

  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
  How would it fare with your departed souls?
  Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  That dost in vile misprision shackle up
  Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Not so; but it hath been the longest night
  Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.


MMMXXXV - "YHEARTHATHSCOP"

  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  And let your fervor, like my master's, be
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
  Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
  And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
  To all sins past, and all that are to come,
  How fain would I have hated all mankind!
  Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.


MMMXXXVI - "EDTHISSORROWCO"

  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
  Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
  Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
  Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
  Or else I will discover nought to thee.


MMMXXXVII - "MEINTHEREARWAR"

  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  I should make very forges of my cheeks,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
  His currish riddles sort not with this place.
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Who will not change a raven for a dove?
  And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.


MMMXXXVIII - "DOFACONQUERDWO"

  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
  Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
  All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
  Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
  No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
  Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
  O, teach me how I should forget to think.


MMMXXXIX - "EGIVENOTAWINDY"

  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Is able with the change to kill and cure.
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
  Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
  It is religion that doth make vows kept;
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
  Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.


MMMXL - "NIGHTARAINYMOR"

  Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
  I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
  Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
  As strange unto your town as to your talk;
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
  In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!


MMMXLI - "ROWTOLINGEROUT"

  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
  That love my friend; and that they know full well
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Great king, within this coffin I present
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Rest on my word, and let not discontent
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
  To see, now, how a jest shall come about!


MMMXLII - "APURPOSEDOVERT"

  Against the churches; though the yesty waves
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?


MMMXLIII - "HROWIFTHOUWILT"

  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
  O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
  I knit my handercher about your brows,
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.


MMMXLIV - "LEAVEMEDONOTLE"

  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMXLV - "AVEMELASTWHENO"

  An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  Thy nerves are in their infancy again
  Wherein we are not destitute for want,
  Henceforth be never number'd among men!
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?


MMMXLVI - "THERPETTYGRIEF"

  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Remember since you owed no more to time
  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Torment myself to catch the English crown:
  Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:
  Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;
  Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  I grant I am a woman; but withal
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.


MMMXLVII - "SHAVEDONETHEIR"

  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
  Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
  He is my prize; I will not look upon.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Impostors to true fear, would well become
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!


MMMXLVIII - "SPITEBUTINTHEO"

  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,
  Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
  That their negotiations all must slack,
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
  He was as calm as virtue--he began
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!


MMMXLIX - "NSETCOMESOSHAL"

  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
  Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  My duty to you both, on equal love,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
  Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
  Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.


MMML - "LITASTEATFIRST"

  Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
  It did not speak before. All solemn things
  These are complements, these are humours; these
  And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  That in a twink she won me to her love.
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
  The silver livery of advised age,
  Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
  If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
  The fear of that withholds my present aid.


MMMLI - "THEVERYWORSTOF"

  That she is busy and she cannot come.
  He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;
  What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
  O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
  That we may be admitted where he is.
  On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
  Fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.


MMMLII - "FORTUNESMIGHTA"

  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
  Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
  I must unto the road, to disembark
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.
  And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.


MMMLIII - "NDOTHERSTRAINS"

  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
  Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
  None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?


MMMLIV - "OFWOEWHICHNOWS"

  O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  Who only by misfortune of the seas
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  In token of which duty, if he please,
  Consisting equally of horse and foot;
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
  O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
  Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.


MMMLV - "EEMWOECOMPARED"

  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
  And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!


MMMLVI - "WITHLOSSOFTHEE"

  Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
  I know thy constellation is right apt
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  The right and fortune of his happy stars;
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MMMLVII - "WILLNOTSEEMSOS"

  With other princes that may best be spared,
  I did present him with the Paris balls.
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
  Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
  No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  Of all his wars within the realm of France?
  That I did never, no, nor never can,
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Mine honour into lust, to take away
  Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son;
  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
  She shall undo her credit with the Moor.


MMMLVIII - "OMEGLORYINTHEI"

  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
  I long with all my heart to see the prince:
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
  His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  In entertainment to my princely queen.


MMMLIX - "RBIRTHSOMEINTH"

  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
  I have forgot why I did call thee back.
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  To meet me at the consecrated fount
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  That him and his they in his palace burn;
  How could he stay till Warwick made return?


MMMLX - "EIRSKILLSOMEIN"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  If old sir Robert did beget us both
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  I saw him not these many years, and yet
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Like usury, applying wet to wet,
  Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
  O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
  My age was never tainted with such shame.
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  It shall do well. But yet do I believe
  Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.


MMMLXI - "THEIRWEALTHSOM"

  This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
  He couples it to his complaining names.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  With too much urging your pernicious lives,
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
  Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:
  So sweet a death as hanging presently.
  One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
  Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!


MMMLXII - "EINTHEIRBODIES"

  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  I will not hear her speak; away with her!
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Sweat in this business and maintain this war?


MMMLXIII - "FORCESOMEINTHE"

  For such disguise as haply shall become
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
  Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
  May any terms acquit me from this chance?
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  I thank my God for my humility.
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  That, from the sense of all civility,
  Hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMMLXIV - "IRGARMENTSTHOU"

  I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Matter against me; and his eye reviled
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
  To the conflicting elements exposed,
  Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
  The mariners say how thou hast disposed
  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?


MMMLXV - "GHNEWFANGLEDIL"

  Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
  For ever and for ever shall be yours.
  And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  I would your grace would take me with you: whom
  Let us withdraw into the other room.


MMMLXVI - "LSOMEINTHEIRHA"

  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
  Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
  My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  I am content to look on: what to speak,
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
  He speaks not like a man of God's making.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  Had I before known this young man his son,
  And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?


MMMLXVII - "WKSANDHOUNDSSO"

  We have had pelting wars, since you refused
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
  Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;
  A little to disquantity your train,
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
  Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Of such misery doth she cut me off.


MMMLXVIII - "MEINTHEIRHORSE"

  Making another head to fight again.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Even for this let us divided live,
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
  O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
  Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMMLXIX - "ANDEVERYHUMOUR"

  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMMLXX - "HATHHISADJUNCT"

  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
  Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  Do my good morrow to them, and anon
  John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!


MMMLXXI - "PLEASUREWHEREI"

  Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  And water cannot wash away your sin.
  So are those errors that in thee are seen
  Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
  Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.


MMMLXXII - "NITFINDSAJOYAB"

  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  False to his children or his wife's allies
  It provokes the desire, but it takes
  No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
  Doth by the idle comments that it makes
  Strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
  And on that day at noon whereon he says
  Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.


MMMLXXIII - "OVETHERESTBUTT"

  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Ten years are spent since first he undertook
  He says they can do nothing in this kind.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
  The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
  Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.


MMMLXXIV - "HESEPARTICULAR"

  His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
  An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Thy will by my performance shall be served:
  I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
  Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
  And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


MMMLXXV - "SARENOTMYMEASU"

  So soon was she along as he was down,
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Now thou and I are new in amity,
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  My speech and what is done, tell him he has
  You may as well do anything most hard,
  My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
  Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.


MMMLXXVI - "REALLTHESEIBET"

  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Let liberty make use of; space enough
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  That means not, hath not, or is not in love!


MMMLXXVII - "TERINONEGENERA"

  That my ability may undergo
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
  I did obey, and sent my peasant home
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  O, teach me how you look, and with what art
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Retain but privilege of a private man?
  After them! nay, before them, if we can.


MMMLXXVIII - "LBESTTHYLOVEIS"

  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  But even then the morning cock crew loud,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
  To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
  Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
  You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
  Let it be who it is: for Romans now
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
  She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.


MMMLXXIX - "BETTERTHANHIGH"

  By holy human law, and common troth,
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  This sword of mine shall give them instant way
  Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
  How coldly those impediments stand forth
  Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
  Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
  His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.


MMMLXXX - "BIRTHTOMERICHE"

  By how much better than my word I am,
  In your protectorship you did devise
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  This is a letter of your own device.
  How he her chamber-window will ascend
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  May be put from her by society:
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
  Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.


MMMLXXXI - "RTHANWEALTHPRO"

  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  The pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
  Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
  And she believes, wherever they are gone,
  Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  That with the hurly death itself awakes?
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  Procure me music ready when he wakes,
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!


MMMLXXXII - "UDERTHANGARMEN"

  Under that colour am I come to scale
  Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
  Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  And, of so great a favour growing proud,
  No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  Against this coming end you should prepare,
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.


MMMLXXXIII - "TSCOSTOFMOREDE"

  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
  Open as day for melting charity;
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
  Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
  Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.


MMMLXXXIV - "LIGHTTHANHAWKS"

  Let him alone, for I remember now
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
  Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
  He hath a garden circummured with brick,
  Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
  That great Northumberland, then false to him,
  He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
  As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
  Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
  Where I will write. All may be well enough.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?


MMMLXXXV - "ORHORSESBEANDH"

  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
  Bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And to survey the bodies of the dead.
  No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Had so much grace to put it in my mind.


MMMLXXXVI - "AVINGTHEEOFALL"

  All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  The life, the right and truth of all this realm
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
  And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
  Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
  Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.


MMMLXXXVII - "MENSPRIDEIBOAS"

  My father and my grandfather were kings,
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
  Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  I have forgot my part, and I am out,
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  If they surcease to be that should survive.
  Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.


MMMLXXXVIII - "TWRETCHEDINTHI"

  That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
  Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
  If he for gold will give us any food;
  Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
  There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  I did present him with the Paris balls.


MMMLXXXIX - "SALONETHATTHOU"

  Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
  And such high vaunts of his nobility,
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Out of my lean and low ability
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Than this is all as true as it is strange:
  Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
  And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
  Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
  Then of thy beauty do I question make,
  Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.


MMMXC - "MAYSTTAKEALLTH"

  My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
  And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
  You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  This day, all things begun come to ill end,
  As dear be to thee as thy father was.
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
  That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
  Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.


MMMXCI - "ISAWAYANDMEMOS"

  Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  And with a larger tether may he walk
  Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
  Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
  You dote on her that cares not for your love.
  Are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  My care is loss of care, by old care done;
  Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
  So doth the cony struggle in the net.


MMMXCII - "TWRETCHEDMAKEB"

  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
  Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
  My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
  Adonis painted by a running brook,
  Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  But I was made a king, at nine months old.


MMMXCIII - "UTDOTHYWORSTTO"

  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
  Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
  You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
  We still have judgment here; that we but teach
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
  The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
  To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
  Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.


MMMXCIV - "STEALTHYSELFAW"

  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  To Henry's body, and supply his place;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Are thou so confident? within what space
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
  For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
  And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
  Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!


MMMXCV - "AYFORTERMOFLIF"

  A man of such a feeble temper should
  Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
  Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  To-morrow shall we visit you again.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,
  Of dear import, and the neglecting it
  For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
  Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
  In this the antique and well noted face
  First to my God and next unto your grace.


MMMXCVI - "ETHOUARTASSURE"

  Establish him in his true sense again,
  The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
  He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
  O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  All the commerce that you have had with Troy
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMXCVII - "DMINEANDLIFENO"

  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  Making them proud of his humility,
  It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
  Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
  Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
  Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
  Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.


MMMXCVIII - "LONGERTHANTHYL"

  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Of moving accidents by flood and field
  Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
  How long a time lies in one little word!
  And have is have, however men do catch:
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!


MMMXCIX - "OVEWILLSTAYFOR"

  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  With brinish current downward flow'd apace:
  It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
  Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  To have a temple built you: all the swords
  A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
  Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
  For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.
  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.


MMMC - "ITDEPENDSUPONT"

  I must unto the road, to disembark
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
  Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
  Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
  Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
  O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.


MMMCI - "HATLOVEOFTHINE"

  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
  For nothing canst thou to damnation add
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  Half of the number that King Priam had,
  I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MMMCII - "THENNEEDINOTTO"

  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  He hath refused it in the open court:
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  Not portable, lie under this report:
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
  The insolence of office, and the spurns
  To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?


MMMCIII - "FEARTHEWORSTOF"

  Full of vexation come I, with complaint
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  To make it truster of your own report
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.


MMMCIV - "WRONGSWHENINTH"

  Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!
  One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
  Never, before this day, in all his life.
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
  Which if we should deny, the most just gods
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
  Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
  That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.


MMMCV - "ELEASTOFTHEMMY"

  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  And in the visitation of the winds,
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  To think their dolour others have endured.
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
  To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
  His daughter first, and then in sequel all,
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Myself of many I am charged withal:
  Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.


MMMCVI - "LIFEHATHENDISE"

  List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
  In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
  For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  How have I been behaved, that he might stick
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Not able to endure the sight of day,
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
  Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MMMCVII - "EABETTERSTATET"

  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,
  Borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  This sleep is sound indeed; this is a sleep
  Then threw he down himself, and all their lives
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
  To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
  An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
  Than from true evidence of good esteem
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!


MMMCVIII - "OMEBELONGSTHAN"

  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  Bears no impression of the thing it was.
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
  Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
  Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
  Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  And do the murder first: if he awake,
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.


MMMCIX - "THATWHICHONTHY"

  Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
  He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
  And made their bends adornings: at the helm
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
  Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
  I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  The which shall turn you to no further harm
  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
  You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.


MMMCX - "HUMOURDOTHDEPE"

  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
  Of any kindred action like to this?
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
  O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
  His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MMMCXI - "NDTHOUCANSTNOT"

  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  O, call not me to justify the wrong
  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  And pursy insolence shall break his wind
  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
  Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.


MMMCXII - "VEXMEWITHINCON"

  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
 eXpect him here: when he shall come and find
  Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Come, let us go: we will include all jars
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  No new device to beat this from his brains?


MMMCXIII - "STANTMINDSINCE"

  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
  Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
  To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
  Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
  She is a theme of honour and renown,
  If this be magic, let it be an art
  Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,
  Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMMCXIV - "THATMYLIFEONTH"

  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are:
  Mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  If I might in entreaties find success--
  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
  Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.


MMMCXV - "YREVOLTDOTHLIE"

  You know that I held Epicurus strong
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
  The greatest of your having lacks a half
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
  To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  I saw him not these many years, and yet
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMCXVI - "OWHATAHAPPYTIT"

  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  Would not the beggar then forget himself?
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  As are of better person than myself,
  To try conclusions, in the basket creep
  Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
  Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
  Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
  Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
  You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  I got them in my country's service, when
  Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.


MMMCXVII - "LEDOIFINDHAPPY"

  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  In Rome, as well as I. mechanic slaves
  For it is after midnight; and ere day
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
  As it is known she is, these moral laws
  Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
  Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.


MMMCXVIII - "TOHAVETHYLOVEH"

  To take the basest and most poorest shape
  Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  You were conducted to a gentle bath
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.


MMMCXIX - "APPYTODIEBUTWH"

  Are now to have no successive degrees,
  Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
  Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  The king and his companions: warily
  Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
  Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
  If it be not, then love doth well denote
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Before the child himself felt he was sick:
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
  Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.


MMMCXX - "ATSSOBLESSEDFA"

  Are of imagination all compact:
  That set thee on to this desert, am bound
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
  Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
  But that between us we can kill a fly
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
  For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
  A beast, to bear every knave's wrong.


MMMCXXI - "IRTHATFEARSNOB"

  If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
  That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
  For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
  Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
  Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
  But low shrubs wither at the cedar's root.


MMMCXXII - "LOTTHOUMAYSTBE"

  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
  Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
  Although against her will, as it appears
  Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
  Scorn and derision never come in tears:
  Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
  By interception which they dream not of.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.


MMMCXXIII - "FALSEANDYETIKN"

  Firm and irrevocable is my doom
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
  Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
  No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  Knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.


MMMCXXIV - "OWITNOTSOSHALL"

  O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
  While she, the picture of pure piety,
  In your protectorship you did devise
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
  To ask the spotted princess how she fares.
  So she at these sad signs draws up her breath
  Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
  Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
  Hover about me with your airy wings
  And mine I pour your ocean all among:
  Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
  Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.


MMMCXXV - "ILIVESUPPOSING"

  I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
  Let them not live to taste this land's increase
  I give this heavy weight from off my head
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
  Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.


MMMCXXVI - "THOUARTTRUELIK"

  There spake my brother; there my father's grave
  Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
  To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
  Known unto these, and to myself disguised!


MMMCXXVII - "EADECEIVEDHUSB"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
  During all question of the gentle truce;
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  How much I have disabled mine estate,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
  But that I was a journeyman to grief?


MMMCXXVIII - "ANDSOLOVESFACE"

  As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,
  So honour cross it from the north to south,
  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Or overthrow incurable ensues.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
  For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
  A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
  Consent upon the order of their fight,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMCXXIX - "MAYSTILLSEEMLO"

  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  And golden Phoebus never be beheld
  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
  I speak of Africa and golden joys.
  Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
  Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?


MMMCXXX - "VETOMETHOUGHAL"

  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  The knee before him, and returns in peace
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Make known to you why I have done this. Come,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
  Have broken with the king; who hath so far
  One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  He hath not money for these Irish wars,
  And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,
  Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.


MMMCXXXI - "TERDNEWTHYLOOK"

  To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
  Though they are made and moulded of things past,
  Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
  You love my son; invention is ashamed,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see
  O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.


MMMCXXXII - "SWITHMETHYHEAR"

  She throws her eyes about the painting round,
  Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
  In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
  Master, go on; and I will follow thee
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he
  He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
  Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!


MMMCXXXIII - "TINOTHERPLACEF"

  This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
  I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Put on what weary negligence you please,
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  A pair so famous. High events as these
  Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Fold in the object that did feed her sight.


MMMCXXXIV - "ORTHERECANLIVE"

  Offend you, and obey you, as I did.
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Consideration, like an angel, came
  And we must root him out. From your affairs
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
  If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMCXXXV - "NOHATREDINTHIN"

  No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
  Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
  Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
  And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
  To have them fall no more: you some permit
  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Do you your office, or give up your place,
  In single opposition, hand to hand,
  No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
  There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  I know not where is that Promethean heat
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!


MMMCXXXVI - "EEYETHEREFOREI"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Reserve their character with golden quill
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
  Of either's colour was the other queen,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Is able with the change to kill and cure.


MMMCXXXVII - "NTHATICANNOTKN"

  Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
  Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
  A royal battle might be won and lost
  Never go home; here starve we out the night.
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Or else return no more into my sight.
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
  No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.


MMMCXXXVIII - "OWTHYCHANGEINM"

  Only thus much I give your grace to know:
  Whereat each tributary subject quakes;
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
  Commit myself, my person and the cause.
  His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;
  And that it was great pity, so it was,
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  I thought upon one pair of English legs
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.


MMMCXXXIX - "ANYSLOOKSTHEFA"

  Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
  Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
  You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
  Surely, by all the glory you have won,
  To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
  He that had wit would think that I had none,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!


MMMCXL - "LSEHEARTSHISTO"

  Let him die: sheathe thy impatience, throw cold
  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,
  Or else what lets it but he would be here?


MMMCXLI - "RYISWRITINMOOD"

  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
  I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
  Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
  Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
  Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
  Next month? and are they not some of them set
  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.


MMMCXLII - "SANDFROWNSANDW"

  Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
  And as the butcher takes away the calf
  Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  For nothing but his majesty's approach.
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
  What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  What ransom must I pay before I pass?


MMMCXLIII - "RINKLESSTRANGE"

  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  I rather will suspect the sun with cold
  Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
  Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
  The better act of purposes mistook
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMCXLIV - "BUTHEAVENINTHY"

  Before the child himself felt he was sick:
  Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
  I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
  How well resembles it the prime of youth,
  Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.


MMMCXLV - "CREATIONDIDDEC"

  Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  And were I any thing but what I am,
  That of his fortunes you should make a staff
  Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Coming and going with thy honey breath.


MMMCXLVI - "REETHATINTHYFA"

  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
  I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
  Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
  That is her ransom; I deliver her;
  Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
  You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  And which the spirit? who deciphers them?


MMMCXLVII - "CESWEETLOVESHO"

  Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  She told him stories to delight his ear;
  With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  That should be in a Roman you do want,
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  O insupportable and touching loss!


MMMCXLVIII - "ULDEVERDWELLWH"

  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
  Durst not presume to look once in the face.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
  What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?


MMMCXLIX - "ATEERTHYTHOUGH"

  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
  Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
  Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
  That they pass by me as the idle wind,
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
  How shall I know if I do choose the right?


MMMCL - "TSORTHYHEARTSW"

  To none of these, except it be the last;
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
  His lands to me, and took it on his death
  You love my son; invention is ashamed,
  Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And in this brainish apprehension kills
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  That some would sing, some other in their bills
  So great an object: can this cockpit hold
  Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.


MMMCLI - "ORKINGSBETHYLO"

  Of either's colour was the other queen,
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
  Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
  Not portable, lie under this report:
  Grow great by your example and put on
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  Ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  He chides to hell and bids the other grow
  Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
  Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
  Of physiognomy might one behold!


MMMCLII - "OKSSHOULDNOTHI"

  O Antony, beg not your death of us.
  King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  So much as from occasion you may glean,
  Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
  Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  I did present him with the Paris balls.


MMMCLIII - "NGTHENCEBUTSWE"

  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
  That was and is the question of these wars.
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
  Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
  When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMCLIV - "ETNESSTELLHOWL"

  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
  Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
  Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.


MMMCLV - "IKEEVESAPPLEDO"

  I do protest I never loved myself
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
  And unregarded age in corners thrown.
  Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  Put me to some impatience: though I lose
  Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  O, that once more you knew but what you are!


MMMCLVI - "THTHYBEAUTYGRO"

  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,
  Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
  You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  And childish error, that they are afraid;
  Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
  The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
  Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
  Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?


MMMCLVII - "WIFTHYSWEETVIR"

  With words, fair looks and liberality?
  It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
  Foretell the ending of mortality.
  This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
  Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
  Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
  Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
  With your derision! none of noble sort
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMCLVIII - "TUEANSWERNOTTH"

  The life, the right and truth of all this realm
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
  Than this is all as true as it is strange:
  How came the noble Timon to this change?


MMMCLIX - "YSHOWTHEYTHATH"

  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
  His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
  Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
  That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,
  How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
  To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
  Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
  And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
  Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!


MMMCLX - "AVEPOWERTOHURT"

  As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
  O let no noble eye profane a tear
  When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  How deep you were within the books of God?
  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.


MMMCLXI - "ANDWILLDONONET"

  Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
  In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
  Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
  Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
  Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
  On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  No settled senses of the world can match
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Thy father was a traitor to the crown.


MMMCLXII - "HATDONOTDOTHET"

  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Of nature and of nations speak aloud
  The fishermen that walk upon the beach
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?
  To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  To Lacedaemon did my land extend.


MMMCLXIII - "HINGTHEYMOSTDO"

  Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
  Infected as her life, she would not live
  Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
  Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
  That fell away have entertainment, but
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
  Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
  The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
  Drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.


MMMCLXIV - "SHOWWHOMOVINGO"

  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
  Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
  Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
  O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!


MMMCLXV - "THERSARETHEMSE"

  The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
  He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
  And so, ere answer knows what question would,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  That so I may by this device at least
  How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMCLXVI - "LVESASSTONEUNM"

  Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  As flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground,
  So shall I live to speak my father's words:
  She would, he will not in her arms be bound;
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Until you see her die again; for then
  Never, before this day, in all his life.
  My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.


MMMCLXVII - "OVEDCOLDANDTOT"

  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  And when we see the figure of the house,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
  The boy gives warning something doth approach.


MMMCLXVIII - "EMPTATIONSLOWT"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
  Although I think 'twas in another sense-
  The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
  I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
  Leave off discourse of disability:
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;
  Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.


MMMCLXIX - "HEYRIGHTLYDOIN"

  Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  Let God for ever keep it from my head,
  Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
  Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.


MMMCLXX - "HERITHEAVENSGR"

  Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  He needs no indirect nor lawless course
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And made him to resign his crown perforce.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Never durst poet touch a pen to write
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.


MMMCLXXI - "ACESANDHUSBAND"

  Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
  Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Should in the furthest east begin to draw
  And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
  Study to break it and not break my troth.
  Because I am the store-house and the shop
  And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.


MMMCLXXII - "NATURESRICHESF"

  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
  And make it but a shadow, as I am.
  The issue of an irreligious Moor,
  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  So many greedy looks of young and old
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Infected be the air whereon they ride;
  Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
  His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.


MMMCLXXIII - "ROMEXPENSETHEY"

  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
 eXpect him here: when he shall come and find
  Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
  He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?


MMMCLXXIV - "ARETHELORDSAND"

  A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Let not your private discord keep away
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
  And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
  Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
  Do challenge thee to trial of a man.


MMMCLXXV - "OWNERSOFTHEIRF"

  O, is it so? But why commands the king
  Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  The meat is cold because you come not home;
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.


MMMCLXXVI - "ACESOTHERSBUTS"

  As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
  Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  The miserable change now at my end
  Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!


MMMCLXXVII - "TEWARDSOFTHEIR"

  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Wherein we are not destitute for want,
  And with his former title greet Macbeth.
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
  O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
  From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
  They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
  He should have had a volume of farewells;
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.


MMMCLXXVIII - "EXCELLENCETHES"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
 eXcept mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
  Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
  How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?


MMMCLXXIX - "UMMERSFLOWERIS"

  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
  My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.


MMMCLXXX - "TOTHESUMMERSWE"

  To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
  O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
  He is prepared, and reason too he should:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
  My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  So many hours must I sport myself;
  Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCLXXXI - "ETTHOUGHTOITSE"

  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
  Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
  O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
  In all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
  Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCLXXXII - "LFITONLYLIVEAN"

  Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
  Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
  If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
  This is the English, not the Turkish court;
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
  Intends his journey; and within three days
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  And I shall here abide the hourly shot
  No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.


MMMCLXXXIII - "DDIEBUTIFTHATF"

  Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
  Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
  If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
  For his advantage that I dearly love.
  The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
  Hath to the marbled mansion all above
  And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
  This loathsome sequestration have I had:
  For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.


MMMCLXXXIV - "LOWERWITHBASEI"

  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Or else he never would compare between.
  Which after him she darts, as one on shore
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
  I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
  The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
  Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
  But rather one that smiles and still invites
  And quench his fiery indignation
  Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  It is not lost; but what an if it were?


MMMCLXXXV - "NFECTIONMEETTH"

  Next month? and are they not some of them set
  For you must know, we have with special soul
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  The Grecian youths are full of quality;
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
  The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
  How fain would I have hated all mankind!


MMMCLXXXVI - "EBASESTWEEDOUT"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
  And wear it in my heart. Why, then, be sad;
  So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Save that, for reverence to some alive,
  Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
  Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.


MMMCLXXXVII - "BRAVESHISDIGNI"

  Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Something to do with you. Come, you're a young
  His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
  Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
  So did this horse excel a common one
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
  Grew a companion to the common streets,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.


MMMCLXXXVIII - "TYFORSWEETESTT"

  To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
  You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
  For, I believe, they are portentous things
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
  Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.
  That beggars mounted run their horse to death.


MMMCLXXXIX - "HINGSTURNSOURE"

  He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
  I am so angry at these abject terms;
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
  They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
  O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMMCXC - "STBYTHEIRDEEDS"

  She prizes not such trifles as these are:
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  But I am constant as the northern star,
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!


MMMCXCI - "LILIESTHATFEST"

  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  I never heard a passion so confused,
  Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
  I swear 'tis better to be much abused
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Speak to the people, and they pity her.
  Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
  Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
  And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
  That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
  From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  So do not you, for you are a light wench.
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.


MMMCXCII - "ERSMELLFARWORS"

  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
  My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
  Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  She gave me none, except an angry word.


MMMCXCIII - "ETHANWEEDSHOWS"

  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  That in their country did them that disgrace,
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  All vows and consecrations giving place:
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  Such barren pleasures, rude society,
  Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  Will conquer him! awake, and win the day!
  Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.


MMMCXCIV - "WEETANDLOVELYD"

  Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
  And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
  Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.


MMMCXCV - "OSTTHOUMAKETHE"

  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  The king shall have my service: but my prayers
  Having some business, do entreat her eyes
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


MMMCXCVI - "SHAMEWHICHLIKE"

  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  Had the full view of, such a noise arose
  And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
  My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
  Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
  In the division of each several crime,
  Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:
  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
  Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMCXCVII - "ACANKERINTHEFR"

  A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
  Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
  And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
  Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  It cannot be avoided but by this;
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
  His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Fare you well; go.    Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!


MMMCXCVIII - "AGRANTROSEDOTH"

  As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
  Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?


MMMCXCIX - "SPOTTHEBEAUTYO"

  Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
  Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
  The studded bridle on a ragged bough
  Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
  You have no stomach having broke your fast;
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.


MMMCC - "FTHYBUDDINGNAM"

  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
  How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  Both are alike; and both alike we like.
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
  My father had a mole upon his brow.


MMMCCI - "EOINWHATSWEETS"

  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
  I do not much dislike the matter, but
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Which you might from relation likewise reap,
  How that ambitious Constance would not cease
  And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
  To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
  Say they are not the men you took them for.
  When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  The which if you with patient ears attend,
  Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.


MMMCCII - "DOSTTHOUTHYSIN"

  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
  Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
  To dispossess that child which is not his?
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
  Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?


MMMCCIII - "SENCLOSETHATTO"

  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!


MMMCCIV - "NGUETHATTELLST"

  Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
  Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
  The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
  The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
  Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.


MMMCCV - "HESTORYOFTHYDA"

  He cried upon it at the merest loss,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  For I have ever verified my friends,
  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.


MMMCCVI - "YSMAKINGLASCIV"

  You say that Edward is your brother's son:
  Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
  Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
  Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
  In this the antique and well noted face
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMCCVII - "IOUSCOMMENTSON"

  If ever man were moved with woman moans,
  O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Such as we see when men restrain their breath
  Commander of this hot malicious day:
  Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
  My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
  Much castigation, exercise devout;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  Show duty, as mistaken all this while
  Or is it Dian, habited like her,
  Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.


MMMCCVIII - "THYSPORTCANNOT"

  Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  Start not; her actions shall be holy as
  Perforce will force it overflow the bank.
  O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
  Rain added to a river that is rank
  That we must curb it upon others' proof;
  Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
  And so unworthily disgrace the man,
  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  O, that your face were not so full of O's!
  This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.


MMMCCIX - "DISPRAISEBUTIN"

  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
  Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  And, often but attended with weak guard,
  Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
  Upon my wretched women, that so long
  To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  Not measuring what use we made of them.


MMMCCX - "AKINDOFPRAISEN"

  A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
  No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
  Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
  For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
  Plant those that have revolted in the van,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
  In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.


MMMCCXI - "AMINGTHYNAMEBL"

  A thing divine, for nothing natural
  Men would carry coals. They would have me as
  It is a quarrel most unnatural,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
  And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
  Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
  Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.


MMMCCXII - "ESSESANILLREPO"

  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
  Some one take order Buckingham be brought
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  And least proportion of humanity:
  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  I can no longer brook thy vanities.
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?


MMMCCXIII - "RTOWHATAMANSIO"

  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
  Hath an aspect of intercession, which
  Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
  The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
  And from that womb where you imprison'd were
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.


MMMCCXIV - "NHAVETHOSEVICE"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
  And entertain'd me with mine own device;
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Even for this let us divided live,
  To sell and mart your offices for gold
  His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  Only to flatter fools and make them bold:
  So you do condescend to help me now.
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
  Else with the like I had requited him.


MMMCCXV - "SGOTWHICHFORTH"

  Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
  Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
  O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
  While Collatine and his consorted lords
  Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
  I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
  Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
  One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.


MMMCCXVI - "EIRHABITATIONC"

  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  I do not greatly care to be deceived,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
  Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
  In the old time of war, would shake the press,
  Take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
  Anon, as patient as the female dove
  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  None else of name; and of all other men
  Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.


MMMCCXVII - "HOSEOUTTHEEWHE"

  He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Or in my life what comfort, when I am
  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
  The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
  That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
  Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMMCCXVIII - "REBEAUTYSVEILD"

  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  And to that woman, when she has done most,
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  If haply you my father do suspect
  Like a Colossus, and we petty men
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.


MMMCCXIX - "OTHCOVEREVERYB"

  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
  But where's the body that I should embrace?


MMMCCXX - "LOTANDALLTHING"

  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
  The unreasonable fury of a beast:
  And able means, we had not parted thus.
  Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
  Let me entreat to know at large the cause
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  To work exceeding miracles on earth.
  Have any way your good deserts forgot,
  I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.


MMMCCXXI - "STURNTOFAIRTHA"

  Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;
  To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
  And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  And make it but a shadow, as I am.


MMMCCXXII - "TEYESCANSEETAK"

  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
  Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
  Never yet taint with love, I send the king.
  Shotten herring. There live not three good men
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MMMCCXXIII - "EHEEDDEARHEART"

  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
  Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  And well said too; for who shall go about
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.


MMMCCXXIV - "OFTHISLARGEPRI"

  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  For what obscured light the heavens did grant
  The gentry to this business. He creates
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
  Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
  Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:
  And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  I would be so triumphant as I am?


MMMCCXXV - "VILEGETHEHARDE"

  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
  Happy in this, she is not yet so old
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
  And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCCXXVI - "STKNIFEILLUSED"

  So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
  Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  For I have heard it is a life in death,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Upon the right and party of her son?
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?


MMMCCXXVII - "DOTHLOSEHISEDG"

  Duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
  Have letters from me to some friends that will
  Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
  On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
  Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Give so much light that I may read by them.


MMMCCXXVIII - "ESOMESAYTHYFAU"

  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  More than his singularity, he goes
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  She told him stories to delight his ear;
  Attended by my men: I will make bold
  You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
  The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
  How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
  Anon, as patient as the female dove
  Upon the very naked name of love.


MMMCCXXIX - "LTISYOUTHSOMEW"

  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  I fear, too many curses on their beads
  So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
  You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
  That may repeat and history his los
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.


MMMCCXXX - "ANTONNESSSOMES"

  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
  Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
  Such harmless creatures have a true respect
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.


MMMCCXXXI - "AYTHYGRACEISYO"

  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.
  This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
  Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
  Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  And that is false thou dost report to us.
  Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
  You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.


MMMCCXXXII - "UTHANDGENTLESP"

  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  To save me from the danger that might come
  He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  No less in pity than his glory which
  To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
  Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.


MMMCCXXXIII - "ORTBOTHGRACEAN"

  Only, good master, while we do admire
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  Been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
  Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
  Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.


MMMCCXXXIV - "DFAULTSARELOVE"

  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
  As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:
  And therefore we must needs admit the means
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMCCXXXV - "DOFMOREANDLESS"

  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
  Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
  Of all mad matches, never was the like.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  And when a woman woos, what woman's son
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
  Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?


MMMCCXXXVI - "THOUMAKESTFAUL"

  Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
  A precious ring, a ring that I must use
  Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  For I by vow am so embodied yours,
  And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.


MMMCCXXXVII - "TSGRACESTHATTO"

  The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Against my near'st of life: and though I could
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  She's not well married that lives married long;
  To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
  Than wife is to the husband? If this law
  The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
  Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?


MMMCCXXXVIII - "THEERESORTASON"

  Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
  Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
  Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill
  So many miles with a pretence? this place?
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?


MMMCCXXXIX - "THEFINGEROFATH"

  The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.
  He was as calm as virtue--he began
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
  I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
  Nor ask advice of any other thought
  Go bid thy master well advise himself:
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
  Are of imagination all compact:
  That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
  Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.


MMMCCXL - "RONEDQUEENTHEB"

  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
  Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
  Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
  How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Both meet to hear and answer such high things.


MMMCCXLI - "ASESTJEWELWILL"

  A woman impudent and mannish grown
  So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
  Join we together, for the public good,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Would you have been so brief with him, he would
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
  Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
  I have to use: thy frank election make;
  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  Letters of commendations to the king.


MMMCCXLII - "BEWELLESTEEMDS"

  Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
  That all the court may echo with the noise.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.


MMMCCXLIII - "OARETHOSEERROR"

  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  And on set purpose let his armour rust
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  To hear the replication of your sounds
  Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Rot and consume themselves in little time.


MMMCCXLIV - "STHATINTHEEARE"

  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
  The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
  Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  And to her white hand see thou do commend
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  I know but of a single part, in aught
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  That hath beside well in his person wrought
  Harry the Sixth bids thee despair, and die!
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMMCCXLV - "SEENTOTRUTHSTR"

  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
  The image of a wicked heinous fault
  Of disobedient opposition
  They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  Thy letters have transported me beyond
  He was not taken well; he had not dined:
  Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
  Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.


MMMCCXLVI - "ANSLATEDANDFOR"

  A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
  No man alive can love in such a sort
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
  And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
  This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MMMCCXLVII - "TRUETHINGSDEEM"

  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
  How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  My health and happy being at your court.


MMMCCXLVIII - "DHOWMANYLAMBSM"

  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  We have had pelting wars, since you refused
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  As you feel doing thus; and see withal
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  You shall have me assisting you in all.
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
  Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.
  But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.


MMMCCXLIX - "IGHTTHESTEMWOL"

  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  To whom in favour she shall give the day,
  He calls me to a restitution large
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
  Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
  On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
  Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.


MMMCCL - "FBETRAYIFLIKEA"

  For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
  But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  That does infect the land: with which they moved
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  I cannot think my sister in the least
  Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.


MMMCCLI - "LAMBHECOULDHIS"

  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
  And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
  My mate, that's never to be found again,
  Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
  Help me this once, that France may get the field.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  I should report that which I say I saw,
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.


MMMCCLII - "LOOKSTRANSLATE"

  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  So many greedy looks of young and old
  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
  Let York be regent; I will yield to him.
  And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
  To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MMMCCLIII - "HOWMANYGAZERSM"

  Has done no more than other knights have done;
  Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
  Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
  Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,
  Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
  God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
  And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
  Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
  Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?


MMMCCLIV - "IGHTSTTHOULEAD"

  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  Set your entreatments at a higher rate
  The enemy, marching along by them,
  That borrow their behaviors from the great,
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?


MMMCCLV - "AWAYIFTHOUWOUL"

  A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
  Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
  And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
  Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
  The interruption of their churlish drums
  His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
  Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
  Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
  Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
  Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!


MMMCCLVI - "DSTUSETHESTREN"

  Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
  Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
  Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red--
  Under your pardon. You must note beside,
  Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt'red stray.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  This door is open; he is gone this way.
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
  Take with you your companions; as you look
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?


MMMCCLVII - "GTHOFALLTHYSTA"

  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,
  To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
  He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
  To do him all the grace and good I could.
  Any hard lesson that may do thee good.


MMMCCLVIII - "TEBUTDONOTSOIL"

  The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  That now on Pompey's basis lies along
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
  Love loving not itself none other can.


MMMCCLIX - "OVETHEEINSUCHS"

  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
  He is complete in feature and in mind
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
  Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
  Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
  Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
  Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.


MMMCCLX - "ORTASTHOUBEING"

  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  Or it will seek me in another place,
  Uncertain of the issue any way.
  But by reflection, by some other things.
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.


MMMCCLXI - "MINEMINEISTHYG"

  May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
  I rather will suspect the sun with cold
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
  I am an officer of state, and come
  Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  It holds his estimate and dignity
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  They will digest this harsh indignity.
  He might have bought me at a common price:
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!


MMMCCLXII - "OODREPORTHOWLI"

  O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
  Have any resting for her true king's queen.
  O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
  Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  I shall receive the money for the same.


MMMCCLXIII - "KEAWINTERHATHM"

  Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
  Either to get the town again or die:
  And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
  Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
  I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
  And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  How could he stay till Warwick made return?
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.


MMMCCLXIV - "YABSENCEBEENFR"

  You chide at him, offending twice as much;
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
  Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


MMMCCLXV - "OMTHEETHEPLEAS"

  O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
  Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
  The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
  How much salt water thrown away in waste,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
  Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  As presence did present them; him in eye,
  So sure I swear to get the town or die.


MMMCCLXVI - "UREOFTHEFLEETI"

  Unto thy value I will mount myself
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Of noble blood in this declining land.
  Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:
  This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
  His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.


MMMCCLXVII - "NGYEARWHATFREE"

  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
  Grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
  Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;
  Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
  And then the king will court thee for his dear;
  The reason that I gather he is mad,
  For here's a young and sweating devil here,
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMMCCLXVIII - "ZINGSHAVEIFELT"

  Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
  I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  Grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
  Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
  Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
  A merchant of incomparable wealth.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
  Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.


MMMCCLXIX - "WHATDARKDAYSSE"

  What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
  And that it was great pity, so it was,
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  And so I would be here, but that I doubt
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
  And lastly, to confirm that amity
  Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
  Sticking together in calamity.
  So sure I swear to get the town or die.
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMCCLXX - "ENWHATOLDDECEM"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  With purpose presently to leave this war.
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
  The studded bridle on a ragged bough
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  My vows are equal partners with thy vows.


MMMCCLXXI - "BERSBARENESSEV"

  Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
  By how much better than my word I am,
  A day in April never came so sweet,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MMMCCLXXII - "ERYWHEREANDYET"

  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
  Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!


MMMCCLXXIII - "THISTIMEREMOVE"

  The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
  He calls me to a restitution large
  If you will take a homely man's advice,
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  To banish your defenders; till at length
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Madam my interpreter, what says she?
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCCLXXIV - "DWASSUMMERSTIM"

  Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
  Which he enforced from me, away he posts
  As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
  She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
  Make verbal repetition of her moans;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Too great oppression for a tender thing.
  I have a servant comes with me along,
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.


MMMCCLXXV - "ETHETEEMINGAUT"

  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
  If he improve them, may well stretch so far
  Nay, he must bear you company. The king
  Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
  And very wisely threat before you sting.
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.


MMMCCLXXVI - "UMNBIGWITHRICH"

  Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
  Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.
  I came before you here a man prepared
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  With other princes that may best be spared,
  I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
  The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
  How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
  How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?


MMMCCLXXVII - "INCREASEBEARIN"

  It is your pleasure to command me in.
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  And unregarded age in corners thrown.
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  An advocate for an imposter! hush!
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.


MMMCCLXXVIII - "GTHEWANTONBURD"

  Go quick away; the story of my life
  The text is old, the orator too green.
  His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Were very pregnant and potential spurs
  As I have such a heart that both mine ears
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Before his sister should her body stoop
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Do challenge thee to trial of a man.


MMMCCLXXIX - "ENOFTHEPRIMELI"

  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
  That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
  In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
  May this be possible? may this be true?
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
  It were no match, your nail against his horn.


MMMCCLXXX - "KEWIDOWDWOMBSA"

  Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
  I say, without characters, fame lives long.
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  What might you think? No, I went round to work
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
  Be hang'd up for example at their doors:
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!


MMMCCLXXXI - "FTERTHEIRLORDS"

  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!


MMMCCLXXXII - "DECEASEYETTHIS"

  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  And to proclaim it civilly, were like
  Such are the poor, in health--or else a feast,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Then belike my children shall have no names:
  To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  It is a nipping and an eager air.
  So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.


MMMCCLXXXIII - "ABUNDANTISSUES"

  As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
  But shall be render'd to your public laws
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
  Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
  Seeming to bury that posterity
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!


MMMCCLXXXIV - "EEMDTOMEBUTHOP"

  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  That holds his honour higher than his ease,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  May through the centre creep and so displease
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  One poor retiring minute in an age
  Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.


MMMCCLXXXV - "EOFORPHANSANDU"

  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
  From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
  Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
  Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
  And I will use the olive with my sword,
  Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
  Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
  Almost no better than so many French;
  None of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  Until the queen his mistress bury it.


MMMCCLXXXVI - "NFATHERDFRUITF"

  No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
  For two and twenty sons I never wept,
  Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Reward did threaten and encourage him,
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,
  Receive so many, and all willingly:
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
  These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  For forth he goes and visits all his host.


MMMCCLXXXVII - "ORSUMMERANDHIS"

  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
  Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
  My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:
  My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
  Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?


MMMCCLXXXVIII - "PLEASURESWAITO"

  Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  And, after, meet you sooner than you would.
  She treads the path that she untreads again;
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
  A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
  That here were well begun and well begot;
  O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!


MMMCCLXXXIX - "NTHEEANDTHOUAW"

  Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
  To grosser issues nor to larger reach
  His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  A night is but small breath and little pause
  Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  The very instant that I saw you, did
  How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
  Abides in me; I say amen to all.
  Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.


MMMCCXC - "AYTHEVERYBIRDS"

  A night is but small breath and little pause
  You have done that you should be sorry for.
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  He that is truly dedicate to war
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  You must forsake this room, and go with us:
  But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;
  If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
  Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.


MMMCCXCI - "AREMUTEORIFTHE"

  An if my father please, I am content.
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Either of king or council, when you went
  More than his singularity, he goes
  Unto your Grace do I in chief address
  Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  In least speak most, to my capacity.
  For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
  They had such courage and audacity?
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMCCXCII - "YSINGTISWITHSO"

  Your master will be dead ere you return;
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
  None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
  Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
  The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
  So shall you share all that he doth possess,
  Where you may abide till your date expire.
  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
  Should have a back or second, that might hold
  Of physiognomy might one behold!


MMMCCXCIII - "DULLACHEERTHAT"

  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
  Clarence hath not another day to live:
  Her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!


MMMCCXCIV - "LEAVESLOOKPALE"

  Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  So much as from occasion you may glean,
  Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
  And say it is the queen and her allies
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MMMCCXCV - "DREADINGTHEWIN"

  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And so I do, and with his gifts present
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
  Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
  I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
  No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.


MMMCCXCVI - "TERSNEARFROMYO"

  There's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
  Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
  O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
  My mistress and her sister stays for you.
  You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
  Or more than any living man could bear.


MMMCCXCVII - "UHAVEIBEENABSE"

  Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
  Him in thy course untainted do allow
  And learn to make a body of a limb.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  If any born at Ephesus be seen
  But we will make it subject to this boy.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
  Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


MMMCCXCVIII - "NTINTHESPRINGW"

  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  That borrow their behaviors from the great,
  In things of great receipt with ease we prove
  Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
  Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  In poison there is physic; and these news,
  Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
  Go speedily and bring again the count.
  Whene'er we come to our account.


MMMCCXCIX - "HENPROUDPIEDAP"

  How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
  Prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  And I will boot thee with what gift beside
  Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.


MMMCCC - "RILDRESSDINALL"

  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
  Devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
  If that she learn not of her eye to look:
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  And then comes answer like an Absey book:
  Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.


MMMCCCI - "HISTRIMHATHPUT"

  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.
  My life were better ended by their hate,
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  Paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
  To work exceeding miracles on earth.


MMMCCCII - "ASPIRITOFYOUTH"

  As I intended, for it wrought on her
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.
  If their purgation did consist in words,
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
  To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,
  O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  For thou hast done a charitable deed.
  You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
  On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.


MMMCCCIII - "INEVERYTHINGTH"

  I give it you, and will maintain my word;
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  Her motion and her station are as one;
  Importing the surrender of those lands
  Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!


MMMCCCIV - "ATHEAVYSATURNL"

  At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
  The anvil of my sword, and do contest
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  And call me father? better burn it now
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
  Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
  Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.


MMMCCCV - "AUGHDANDLEAPDW"

  Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
  Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  And I will stoop and humble my intents
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?


MMMCCCVI - "ITHHIMYETNORTH"

  Is that Camillo was an honest man;
  Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
  I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
  My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
  Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Tell me wherein have I offended most?
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
  How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?


MMMCCCVII - "ELAYSOFBIRDSNO"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  A man already made, as to remit
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Omitted, all the voyage of their life
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
  Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
  Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
  O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!


MMMCCCVIII - "RTHESWEETSMELL"

  Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
  These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  To blot old books and alter their contents,
  Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?


MMMCCCIX - "OFDIFFERENTFLO"

  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
  Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
  For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  The pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
  For things are often spoke and seldom meant:
  Looking before and after, gave us not
  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!


MMMCCCX - "WERSINODOURAND"

  With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
  In human action and capacity,
  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
  Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
  Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
  Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
  Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  And in the imitation of these twain--
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!


MMMCCCXI - "INHUECOULDMAKE"

  It is impossible they bear it out.
  Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Even for revenge mock my destruction!
  Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
  Of thy intents desires instruction,
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
  Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
  Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


MMMCCCXII - "MEANYSUMMERSST"

  Making, to take your imagination,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  And quench his fiery indignation
  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
  You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
  See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
  My strength can give you: then no more remains,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  The gain I seek is quiet in the match.


MMMCCCXIII - "ORYTELLORFROMT"

  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
  Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
  Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
  Means to immure herself and not be seen.
  This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.


MMMCCCXIV - "HEIRPROUDLAPPL"

  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Of a glad father compass thee about!
  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
  Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  And set thy diadem upon my head;
  Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.


MMMCCCXV - "UCKTHEMWHERETH"

  Unto your Grace do I in chief address
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  This is my king, York, I do not mistake;
  Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
  Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
  How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  This day, all things begun come to ill end,
  He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.


MMMCCCXVI - "EYGREWNORDIDIW"

  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
  Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Or any air of music touch their ears,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?


MMMCCCXVII - "ONDERATTHELILY"

  O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
  Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
  They found him dead and cast into the streets,
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
  If what in rest you have in right you hold,
  Love make your fortunes twenty times above
  You dote on her that cares not for your love.


MMMCCCXVIII - "SWHITENORPRAIS"

  Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,
  Were all thy children kind and natural!
  How that ambitious Constance would not cease
  It is a quarrel most unnatural,
  That honourable grief lodged here which burns
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
  Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.


MMMCCCXIX - "ETHEDEEPVERMIL"

  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  Him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
  Envied against the people, seeking means
  Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  My father gave him welcome to the shore;
  It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.


MMMCCCXX - "IONINTHEROSETH"

  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  O any thing, of nothing first create!
  Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
  If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
  Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  The consequence is then thy jealous fits
  Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.


MMMCCCXXI - "EYWEREBUTSWEET"

  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  You take me in too dolorous a sense;
  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  But is four Volsces? none of you but is
  Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
  There's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Were to incense the boar to follow us
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.


MMMCCCXXII - "BUTFIGURESOFDE"

  Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  I will be squared by this. I do believe
  God pardon them that are the cause of it!
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  On, officer, to prison till it come.
  For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
  Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMCCCXXIII - "LIGHTDRAWNAFTE"

  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  I shall obey you in all fair commands.
  God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  That I may call thee something more than man
  Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  And mine I pour your ocean all among:
  Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
  No leisure had he to enrank his men;
  And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
  Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
  That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MMMCCCXXIV - "RYOUYOUPATTERN"

  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
  Or is he but retired to make him strong?
  Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
  Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
  Using the names of men instead of men;
  Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Than when thou wert protector to thy King.
  The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Neglect the visitation of my friends.


MMMCCCXXV - "OFALLTHOSEYETS"

  O you immortal gods! I will not go.
  For we are peremptory to dispatch
  Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
  His insolence draws folly from my lips;
  Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.


MMMCCCXXVI - "EEMDITWINTERST"

  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  I hope I shall know your honour better.
  There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
  When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
  Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
  None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
  To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  So deal with him as I prove true to you.
  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.


MMMCCCXXVII - "ILLANDYOUAWAYA"

  Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
  Looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
  Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
  Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.


MMMCCCXXVIII - "SWITHYOURSHADO"

  Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
  Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
  I am left out; for me nothing remains.
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
  Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
  O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  As I have heard him swear himself there's one
  Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
  On what condition stands it and wherein?


MMMCCCXXIX - "WIWITHTHESEDID"

  What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
  I should report that which I say I saw,
  The leading of thine own revenges, take
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  Turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  Is lust in action; and till action, lust
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.


MMMCCCXXX - "PLAYTHEFORWARD"

  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
  And my true eyes have never practised how
  You say you do not know the lady's mind:
  There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
  He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:
  Or as thy father and his father did,
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  When I to feast expressly am forbid;
  And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.


MMMCCCXXXI - "VIOLETTHUSDIDI"

  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
  Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
  If that the devil and mischance look big
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Intended or committed was this fault?


MMMCCCXXXII - "CHIDESWEETTHIE"

  Can justly praise but what he does affect:
  His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
  It is my will, the which if thou respect,
  Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  With other princes that may best be spared,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
  Than is her custom: it is still her use
  Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
  If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MMMCCCXXXIII - "FWHENCEDIDSTTH"

  For you all; you have horses for yourselves:
  Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
  Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  I grant I am a woman; but withal
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
  The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
  There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
  How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?


MMMCCCXXXIV - "OUSTEALTHYSWEE"

  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
  So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
  Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
  Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
  Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
  Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
  Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMCCCXXXV - "TTHATSMELLSIFN"

  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  More health and happiness betide my liege
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  It seems then that the tidings of this broil
  From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
  Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!


MMMCCCXXXVI - "OTFROMMYLOVESB"

  O, two such silver currents, when they join,
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  My resolution, husband, do thou take;
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  You would have thought the very windows spake,
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Such harmless creatures have a true respect
  Base men, that use them to so base effect!


MMMCCCXXXVII - "REATHTHEPURPLE"

  Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
  That those which fly before the battle ends
  Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
  The execution of it shall make known.
  Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?


MMMCCCXXXVIII - "PRIDEWHICHONTH"

  Put but a little water in a spoon,
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  I think so too; for never gazed the moon
  Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  If any be, the trespass of the queen.
  Confer with me of murder and of death:
  How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  Hear me with patience but to speak a word.


MMMCCCXXXIX - "YSOFTCHEEKFORC"

  You were as good to shoot against the wind.
  So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
  Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Have I not here the best cards for the game,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.


MMMCCCXL - "OMPLEXIONDWELL"

  O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
  Making you ever better than his praise
  Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
  Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
 eXcels whatever yet you look'd upon
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
  Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  Like to a censer in a barber's shop.


MMMCCCXLI - "SINMYLOVESVEIN"

  Stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
  You all did love him once, not without cause:
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  I rather will suspect the sun with cold
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.


MMMCCCXLII - "STHOUHASTTOOGR"

  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
  The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
  Saving your merry humour, here's the note
  To the conflicting elements exposed,
  This king were great, his greatness was no guard
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.


MMMCCCXLIII - "OSSLYDYEDTHELI"

  O miracle of men!--him did you leave--
  So many hours must I take my rest;
  So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
  Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
  You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
  Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
  That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.


MMMCCCXLIV - "LYICONDEMNEDFO"

  Labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Doing the execution and the act
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
  Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
  For now she knows it is no gentle chase,
  Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.


MMMCCCXLV - "RTHYHANDANDBUD"

  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess,--
  He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  He well may be a stranger, for he comes
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
  As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
  Under your pardon. You must note beside,
  Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.


MMMCCCXLVI - "SOFMARJORAMHAD"

  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  Or have we eaten on the insane root
  Found his deserts: how innocent I was
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
  My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.


MMMCCCXLVII - "STOLNTHYHAIRTH"

  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  Tell me wherein have I offended most?
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
  This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
  His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
  You have your wish; my will is even this:
  He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
  Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
  I know, in honour, O, that ever I
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.


MMMCCCXLVIII - "EROSESFEARFULL"

  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
  Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
  Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Let us sway on and face them in the field.


MMMCCCXLIX - "YONTHORNSDIDST"

  You know not why we came to visit you-
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
  I do forswear them; and I here protest,
  Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
  Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
  To join with men in scorning your poor friend?


MMMCCCL - "ANDONEBLUSHING"

  Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
  Near to the king in blood, and near in love
  Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.


MMMCCCLI - "SHAMEANOTHERWH"

  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  And therefore level not to hit their lives.
  May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And thereupon he sends you this good news,
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
  They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
  He was not taken well; he had not dined:
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!


MMMCCCLII - "ITEDESPAIRATHI"

  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
  Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
  A couching lion and a ramping cat,
  Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
  Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
  I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.


MMMCCCLIII - "RDNORREDNORWHI"

  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Which was the model of that Danish seal;
  Her times of preservation, which perforce
  Inferring arguments of mighty force.


MMMCCCLIV - "TEHADSTOLNOFBO"

  Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
  Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
  Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
  For in the shade of death I shall find joy;
  But that necessity so bow'd the state
  Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.


MMMCCCLV - "THANDTOHISROBB"

  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  Have I since your departure had, my lords.
  And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
  The lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
  If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
  Shut door upon me, and so give me up
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,
  But like of each thing that in season grows.


MMMCCCLVI - "ERYHADANNEXDTH"

  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
  Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
  A mighty and a fearful head they are,
  Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
  No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
 eXcepting one, I would he were the best
  Do you set down your name in the scroll of
  To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.


MMMCCCLVII - "YBREATHBUTFORH"

  You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
  Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
  There left behind and settled certain French;
  Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
  But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
  Under what colour he commits this ill.
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  From a pure heart command thy rebel will:
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!


MMMCCCLVIII - "ISTHEFTINPRIDE"

  In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
  Say, if my father render fair return,
  This little abstract doth contain that large
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
  Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land
  If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  I have a mind presages me such thrift,
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCCCLIX - "OFALLHISGROWTH"

  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
  As harbingers preceding still the fates
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  Let liberty make use of; space enough
  Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
  Go home with it and please your wife withal;
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
  Which reformation must be sudden too,
  Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
  He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.


MMMCCCLX - "AVENGEFULCANKE"

  As, painfully to pore upon a book
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
  Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
  Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
  Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
  Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMCCCLXI - "REATHIMUPTODEA"

  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  As all things shall redound unto your good.
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  I had forgot myself; am I not king?
  More French: I shall never move thee in French,
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  Plead my successive title with your swords:
  The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;
  O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  And perish ye, with your audacious prate!


MMMCCCLXII - "THMOREFLOWERSI"

  That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
  Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  Methinks I should not thus be led along,
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  For such disguise as haply shall become
  Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
  Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
  We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  I could marry this wench for this device.


MMMCCCLXIII - "NOTEDYETINONEC"

  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
  The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
  I will denounce a curse upon his head.
  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  O, may such purple tears be alway shed
  Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.


MMMCCCLXIV - "OULDSEEBUTSWEE"

  O masters, if I were disposed to stir
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
  See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  The people fear me; for they do observe
  She is a woman, therefore may be won;
  We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMCCCLXV - "TORCOLOURITHAD"

  Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
  I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
  Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
  Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
  And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
  Delivered up again with peaceful words?


MMMCCCLXVI - "STOLNFROMTHEEW"

  Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;
  They fell together all, as by consent;
  Of a glad father compass thee about!
  Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Merrily, merrily shall I live now
  Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
  Him in thy course untainted do allow
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?


MMMCCCLXVII - "HEREARTTHOUMUS"

  He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  To do him wrong or any way impeach
  That stands upon the rolling restless stone--
  Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
  O, had we never, never hunted there!--
  Unable to support this lump of clay,
  Myself have often heard him say and swear
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.


MMMCCCLXVIII - "ETHATTHOUFORGE"

  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  That souls of animals infuse themselves
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  Actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
  That now on Pompey's basis lies along
  To glean the broken ears after the man
  How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
  For all my reign hath been but as a scene
  O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?


MMMCCCLXIX - "TSTSOLONGTOSPE"

  Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,
  So that the art and practic part of life
  Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
  So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
  Out of the path which shall directly lead
  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
  Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
  Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
  The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
  Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
  Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.


MMMCCCLXX - "AKOFTHATWHICHG"

  A man whom both the waters and the wind,
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
  To lesson me and tell me some good mean
  Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
  This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
  Were all thy children kind and natural!
  His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
  It is a quarrel most unnatural,
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
  Graves only be men's works and death their gain!


MMMCCCLXXI - "IVESTHEEALLTHY"

  Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,
  This is a strange repose, to be asleep
  He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
  Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
  Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.
  There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
  How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
  Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?


MMMCCCLXXII - "MIGHTSPENDSTTH"

  May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
  That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Not measuring what use we made of them.
  Did look no better to that weighty charge.
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
  To take advantage on presented joy;
  He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.


MMMCCCLXXIII - "OUTHYFURYONSOM"

  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  The great assay of art; but at his touch--
  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I
  For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
  Upon that day either prepare to die
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.


MMMCCCLXXIV - "EWORTHLESSSONG"

  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
  O, teach me how you look, and with what art
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
  His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
  Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
  Go, call before me all the lords in court.


MMMCCCLXXV - "DARKENINGTHYPO"

  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
  I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  Thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
  How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
  You follow the young Prince up and down, like
  Pretend some alteration in good will?
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.


MMMCCCLXXVI - "WERTOLENDBASES"

  What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  To let him spend his time no more at home,
  One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
  Let us from point to point this story know,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,
  Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
  By humble message and by promised means:
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!


MMMCCCLXXVII - "UBJECTSLIGHTRE"

  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
  John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
  I did present him with the Paris balls.
  God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
  Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMCCCLXXVIII - "TURNFORGETFULM"

  The honey fee of parting tender'd is:
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
  Forgets the shows of love to other men.
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.


MMMCCCLXXIX - "USEANDSTRAIGHT"

  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
  Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
  I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
  The precious note of it with a base slave.


MMMCCCLXXX - "REDEEMINGENTLE"

  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  That, he awaking when the other do,
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MMMCCCLXXXI - "NUMBERSTIMESOI"

  Never was seen so black a day as this:
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
  Be happy that my arms are out of use:
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
  That's he that was Othello: here I am.
  Is all the policy, strength and defence,
  My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
  Out of my lean and low ability
  I thank my God for my humility.


MMMCCCLXXXII - "DLYSPENTSINGTO"

  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Your heart is full of something that does take
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  That here were well begun and well begot;
  Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
  Iago, look with care about the town,
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
  That's he that was Othello: here I am.
  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?


MMMCCCLXXXIII - "THEEARTHATDOTH"

  This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  To hear the replication of your sounds
  Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
  A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
  Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
  Of what degree soever, with his brother.
  That in your country's service drew your swords:
  Have I since your departure had, my lords.


MMMCCCLXXXIV - "THYLAYSESTEEMA"

  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
  How will my mother for a father's death
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
  You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
  She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  And then your highness shall command a peace.


MMMCCCLXXXV - "NDGIVESTHYPENB"

  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
  To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
  He that helps him take all my outward worth.
  Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
  Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
  But few of any sort, and none of name.


MMMCCCLXXXVI - "OTHSKILLANDARG"

  Of female favour, and bestows himself
  True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
  Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
  A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
  Never to England shall he bear his life;
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!


MMMCCCLXXXVII - "UMENTRISERESTY"

  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
  The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
  You shall not be admitted to his sight.


MMMCCCLXXXVIII - "MUSEMYLOVESSWE"

  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Mars's hot minion is returned again;
  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
  Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
  When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.


MMMCCCLXXXIX - "ETFACESURVEYIF"

  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  That I in thy abundance am sufficed
  Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:
  And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
  Can no way change you to a milder form,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Yet most suspected, as the time and place
  If you had won it, certainly you had.
  For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.


MMMCCCXC - "TIMEHAVEANYWRI"

  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt
  Now do I long to hear how you were found;
  You less know how to value her desert
  Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.


MMMCCCXCI - "NKLEGRAVENTHER"

  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
  Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  Regard thy danger, and along with me!


MMMCCCXCII - "EIFANYBEASATIR"

  Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
  If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
  For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Anon, as patient as the female dove
  She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
  As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMMCCCXCIII - "ETODECAYANDMAK"

  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
  Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Cold death aside, and with the other sends
  And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
  Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
  And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
  My father and my grandfather were kings,
  As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
  Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.


MMMCCCXCIV - "ETIMESSPOILSDE"

  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
  If all were minded so, the times should cease
  My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
  I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
  Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
  Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMCCCXCV - "SPISEDEVERYWHE"

  Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,
  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
  Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  His wonders and his praises do contend
  Either of you to be the other's end.


MMMCCCXCVI - "REGIVEMYLOVEFA"

  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
  I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
  Yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
  And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.


MMMCCCXCVII - "MEFASTERTHANTI"

  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?
  All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.
  His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
  And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
  Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
  That was not forced; that never was inclined
  I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.


MMMCCCXCVIII - "MEWASTESLIFESO"

  More health and happiness betide my liege
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,
  She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
  Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  So sure I swear to get the town or die.
  Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
  O, that it were as like as it is true!


MMMCCCXCIX - "THOUPREVENTSTH"

  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  He hath commission from thy wife and me
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Until his very downfall in the sea:
  Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.


MMMCD - "ISSCYTHEANDCRO"

  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
  Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
  She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
  Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  All is imaginary she doth prove,
  Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  O, they love least that let men know their love.


MMMCDI - "OKEDKNIFEOTRUA"

  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
  For you must know, we have with special soul
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
  The anvil of my sword, and do contest
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?


MMMCDII - "NTMUSEWHATSHAL"

  Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
  To take her by the hand and bid her go,
  Matter against me; and his eye reviled
  Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
  State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Were it but told you, should be hooted at
  Hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
  Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
  To be set high in place, we did commend
  Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
  He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
  And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.


MMMCDIII - "LBETHYAMENDSFO"

  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  But that one half which is unsatisfied,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  The commons will not then be satisfied.
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  You do the king my father too much wrong
  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Methinks I should not thus be led along,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
  Or who should study to prefer a peace.


MMMCDIV - "RTHYNEGLECTOFT"

  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
  To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!


MMMCDV - "RUTHINBEAUTYDY"

  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
  I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
  Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
  They might have lived to bear and he to taste
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.


MMMCDVI - "EDBOTHTRUTHAND"

  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  To think so base a thought: it were too gross
  Here is my hand; the premises observed,
  And to that woman, when she has done most,
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Do a fair message to his kingly ears?


MMMCDVII - "BEAUTYONMYLOVE"

  Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
  Your highness should deliver up your crown.
  Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
  O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?


MMMCDVIII - "DEPENDSSODOSTT"

  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
  Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
  That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!


MMMCDIX - "HOUTOOANDTHERE"

  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  The laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.
  Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
  Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?


MMMCDX - "INDIGNIFIEDMAK"

  I saw him not these many years, and yet
  Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
  Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,
  I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
  Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Merrily, merrily shall I live now
  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MMMCDXI - "EANSWERMUSEWIL"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Such aid as I can spare you shall command;
  What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
  I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!


MMMCDXII - "TTHOUNOTHAPLYS"

  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  To their approvers they are people such
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  That virtue must go through. We must not stint
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  As he will lose his head ere give consent
  Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
  Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.


MMMCDXIII - "AYTRUTHNEEDSNO"

  A foot of honour better than I was;
  Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
  Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  That for a fantasy and trick of fame
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  No longer session hold upon my shame,
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.


MMMCDXIV - "COLOURWITHHISC"

  Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
  O, pity, God, this miserable age!
  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  What he will do: but if he will not yield,
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
  Hath an aspect of intercession, which
  How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Some speedy messenger bid her repair
  Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.


MMMCDXV - "OLOURFIXDBEAUT"

  O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
  Long after fearing to creep forth again;
  Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
  Using the names of men instead of men;
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
  I am so far from granting thy request
 eXpecting in return twenty for one?
  Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
  Before I see thee seated in that throne
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  As if increase of appetite had grown
  Upon your oath of service to the pope,
  This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.


MMMCDXVI - "YNOPENCILBEAUT"

  Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
  Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
  O, but remember this another day,
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
  Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
  I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  But be it as it may: I here entail
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
  Upon the next occasion that we meet,
  That oft they interchange each other's seat.


MMMCDXVII - "YSTRUTHTOLAYBU"

  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
  The greatest of your having lacks a half
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
  His time of folly and his time of sport;
  Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  But in the onset come; so shall I taste
  Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.


MMMCDXVIII - "TBESTISBESTIFN"

  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  But now that fresh fair mirror, dim and old,
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Should have a back or second, that might hold
  The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
  In that each of you have forsworn his book,
  She is as forward of her breeding as
  Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
  That I repair to Rome, I am content.
  If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
  For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.


MMMCDXIX - "EVERINTERMIXDB"

  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  My marvel and my message. To your court
  I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
 eXcept some petty towns of no import:
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?


MMMCDXX - "ECAUSEHENEEDSN"

  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Can any face of brass hold longer out?
  Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
  Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
  Stood challenger on mount of all the age
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
  Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
  Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.


MMMCDXXI - "OPRAISEWILTTHO"

  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  And we will nothing waste till you return.
  If you bethink yourself of any crime
  So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
  I see I cannot get thy father's love;
  Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
  That you to-day promised to tell me of?
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  How lies their battle? know you on which side
  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!


MMMCDXXII - "UBEDUMBEXCUSEN"

  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  But God in mercy so deal with my soul,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
  My spritely brethren, I propend to you
  But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
 eXpress impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.


MMMCDXXIII - "OTSILENCESOFOR"

  Out of my lean and low ability
  Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  In his true, native, and most proper shape,
  Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
  Come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Says that you savour too much of your youth,
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.


MMMCDXXIV - "TLIESINTHEETOM"

  This ensign here of mine was turning back;
  Like one of two contending in a prize,
  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
  Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
  Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
  Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  This must not be thus borne: this will break out
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.


MMMCDXXV - "AKEHIMMUCHOUTL"

  As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  My education been in arts and arms;
  May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
  Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
  Concerning the French journey: I replied,
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  O, had they in that darksome prison died!
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
  Longer than I have time to tell his years!


MMMCDXXVI - "IVEAGILDEDTOMB"

  If ever- as that ever may be near-
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
  Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
  It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
  Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
  Bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.


MMMCDXXVII - "ANDTOBEPRAISED"

  As that same ague which hath made you lean.
  No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
  To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  And then to crave a league of amity;
  It hath been taught us from the primal state,
  Sticking together in calamity.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  During the time Edward the Third did reign.


MMMCDXXVIII - "OFAGESYETTOBET"

  O Stephano. hast any more of this?
  From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
  And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
  Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
  O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
  Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?


MMMCDXXIX - "HENDOTHYOFFICE"

  Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
  Diana's temple is not distant far,
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
  From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
  France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;
  I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
  Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMCDXXX - "MUSEITEACHTHEE"

  My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
  Strange images of death. As thick as hail
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
  Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
  He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
  They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMMCDXXXI - "HOWTOMAKEHIMSE"

  He should have had a volume of farewells;
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
  To whom you are but as a form in wax
  Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  And with deep groans the diapason bear;
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
  I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
  Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MMMCDXXXII - "EMLONGHENCEASH"

  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Of English Henry, shall this night appear
  Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
  Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
  He hath but as offended in a dream!
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,
  He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.


MMMCDXXXIII - "ESHOWSNOWMYLOV"

  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
  Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
  You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
  O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMCDXXXIV - "EISSTRENGTHEND"

  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  So far from cheer and from your former state.
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  There shall no figure at such rate be set
  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!


MMMCDXXXV - "THOUGHMOREWEAK"

  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Of disobedient opposition
  Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
  Know I these men that come along with you?


MMMCDXXXVI - "INSEEMINGILOVE"

  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
  I think, by some odd gimmors or device
  No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
  Give even way unto my rough affairs;
  I have inform'd his highness so at large
  Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
  Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMCDXXXVII - "NOTLESSTHOUGHL"

  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  The ringleader and head of all this rout,
  Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
  Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.


MMMCDXXXVIII - "ESSTHESHOWAPPE"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
  The unity and married calm of states
  He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Who in unnecessary action swarm
  And think it no addition, nor my wish,
  Praise her but for this her without-door form,
  Provokes itself and like the current flies
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


MMMCDXXXIX - "ARTHATLOVEISME"

  As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Against the unseen secrecy of night:
  That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
  O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
  Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
  More relative than this. The play's the thing
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMMCDXL - "RCHANDIZEDWHOS"

  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
  He calls for the tortures: what will you say
  And to be praised of ages yet to be.
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
  Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
  With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
  Her immortality, and made her thrall
  O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.


MMMCDXLI - "ERICHESTEEMING"

  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Could to no issue of true honour bring.
  Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  My health and happy being at your court.
  I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
  No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?


MMMCDXLII - "THEOWNERSTONGU"

  Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
  Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
  She either gives a stomach and no food-
  The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
  Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!


MMMCDXLIII - "EDOTHPUBLISHEV"

  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
  He be as miserably slain as I.
  Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
  Unless it be to think that she is by
  Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
  I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
  So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
  How might a prince of my great hopes forget
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMCDXLIV - "ERYWHEREOURLOV"

  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
  Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
  He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Of threescore and two years; a silly time
  Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
  One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MMMCDXLV - "EWASNEWANDTHEN"

  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
  As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
  Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  That ever love did make thee run into,
  He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


MMMCDXLVI - "BUTINTHESPRING"

  By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
  I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
  Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.


MMMCDXLVII - "WHENIWASWONTTO"

  Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
  And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
  Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
  O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
  Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
  To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
  They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
  Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.


MMMCDXLVIII - "GREETITWITHMYL"

  Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  That, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
  Is not inured; return again in haste;
  That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
  Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  Treason is not inherited, my lord;
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!


MMMCDXLIX - "AYSASPHILOMELI"

  Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought
  Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
  Should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
  And violenteth in a sense as strong
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
  In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
  May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
  I know not that, when he knows what I know.


MMMCDL - "NSUMMERSFRONTD"

  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
  Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.
  Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.


MMMCDLI - "OTHSINGANDSTOP"

  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
  That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
  He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
  Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
  I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
  Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
  Then in the number let me pass untold,
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!


MMMCDLII - "SHERPIPEINGROW"

  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
  I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
  Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  It hath been taught us from the primal state,
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.
  Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and
  What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?


MMMCDLIII - "THOFRIPERDAYSN"

  Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
  How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  For Adon's sake, a youngster proud and wild;
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  I gin to be aweary of the sun,
  Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
  You may as well forbid the mountain pines
  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.


MMMCDLIV - "OTTHATTHESUMME"

  O, but I love his lady too too much,
  The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
  The great assay of art; but at his touch--
  Have any resting for her true king's queen.
  And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
  To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
  Most abject in regard and dear in use!
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMCDLV - "RISLESSPLEASAN"

  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Less valiant than the virgin in the night
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.


MMMCDLVI - "TNOWTHANWHENHE"

  There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
  This morning, like the spirit of a youth
  High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
  Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
  Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MMMCDLVII - "RMOURNFULHYMNS"

  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  O, is it so? But why commands the king
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
  From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
  Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
  Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.


MMMCDLVIII - "DIDHUSHTHENIGH"

  Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
  Doth by the idle comments that it makes
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  Upon the head of this forgetful man
  She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
  How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  He might have took his answer long ago.


MMMCDLIX - "TBUTTHATWILDMU"

  Though their injunction be to bar my doors
  By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,
  Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
  In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
  Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
  Undoing all, as all had never been!


MMMCDLX - "SICBURTHENSEVE"

  So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
  In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
  Can no way change you to a milder form,
  Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
  Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCDLXI - "RYBOUGHANDSWEE"

  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
  Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
  And help to set a head on headless Rome.
  Not like a woman; for I would prevent
  Deal with poison; I will possess him with
  Sir, I commend you to your own content.
  Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMCDLXII - "TSGROWNCOMMONL"

  To bring him to the haven; left these notes
  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Or is he but retired to make him strong?
  Whose nature is so far from doing harms
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Met us again and madly bent on us,
  My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
  Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.


MMMCDLXIII - "OSETHEIRDEARDE"

  On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
  Such barren pleasures, rude society,
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Hop forty paces through the public street;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  I know not where is that Promethean heat
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Dying with mother's dug between its lips:
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  Religious love put out Religion's eye:
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMCDLXIV - "LIGHTTHEREFORE"

  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  If haply you my father do suspect
  Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
  He holds your temper in a high respect
  Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
  The wager thou hast won; and I will add
  His promises fly so beyond his state
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
  O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMMCDLXV - "LIKEHERISOMETI"

  Losing both beauty and utility.
  In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
  King Henry's peers and chief nobility
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  How now for mitigation of this bill
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  I would dissemble with my nature where
  Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  That to close prison he commanded her,
  I will determine this before I stir.


MMMCDLXVI - "MEHOLDMYTONGUE"

  Make verbal repetition of her moans;
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Out of her favour, where I am in love.
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
  Of the all-building law; and that there were
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMMCDLXVII - "BECAUSEIWOULDN"

  By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
  And, as you answer, I do know the scope
  Until the elder sister first be wed.
  Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
  Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
  Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?


MMMCDLXVIII - "OTDULLYOUWITHM"

  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
  Othello, leave some officer behind,
  Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
  Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
  It is an honour that I dream not of.
  Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
  He holds your temper in a high respect
  Make livers pale and lustihood deject.


MMMCDLXIX - "YSONGALACKWHAT"

  You smell this business with a sense as cold
  She shows a body rather than a life,
  Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
  Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
  Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
  As after some oration fairly spoke
  Looking the way her harmless young one went,
  And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
  Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
  Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
  Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
  Have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
  And by their vehement instigation,
  That tremble at the imagination?


MMMCDLXX - "POVERTYMYMUSEB"

  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  Of physiognomy might one behold!
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
  That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
  Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
  Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
  Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
  Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  But much of grief shows still some want of wit.


MMMCDLXXI - "RINGSFORTHTHAT"

  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
  Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,
  Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
  For quick accumulation of renown,
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  He will recover straight: when he is gone,
  Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  And that unbodied figure of the thought
  That this fair action may on foot be brought.


MMMCDLXXII - "HAVINGSUCHASCO"

  He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
  And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  I am the most offending soul alive.
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.
  So honour cross it from the north to south,
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;
  How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
  And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  Come not within the measure of my wrath;
  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!


MMMCDLXXIII - "PETOSHOWHERPRI"

  Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  There let them bide until we have devised
  Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
  So near with their lips that their breaths embraced
  Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?
  His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Possess them not with fear; take from them now
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.


MMMCDLXXIV - "DETHEARGUMENTA"

  Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
  To play the broker in mine own behalf;
  And would afford my speechless vizard half.


MMMCDLXXV - "LLBAREISOFMORE"

  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  But I will find him when he lies asleep,
  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  If I know more of any man alive
  Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
  Make the young old, the old become a child.
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMCDLXXVI - "WORTHTHANWHENI"

  Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
  Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Than twenty times the value of the sum
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
  How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,
  And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
  Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
  When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
  How easily murder is discovered!
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
  In weeping after this untimely bier.


MMMCDLXXVII - "THATHMYADDEDPR"

  This hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
  And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  All the charactery of my sad brows:
  Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!


MMMCDLXXVIII - "AISEBESIDEOBLA"

  A thievish living on the common road?
  I would be friends with you and have your love,
  Set down, set down your honourable load,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
  Dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  But he would bite none; just as I do now,
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.


MMMCDLXXIX - "MEMENOTIFINOMO"

  Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled
  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  It were not good; for therein should we read
  Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
  I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  More than a wild exposture to each chance
  Of all his wars within the realm of France?


MMMCDLXXX - "RECANWRITELOOK"

  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Could to no issue of true honour bring.
  And now at length they overflow their banks.
  Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
  What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  That greatness should so grossly offer it:
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
  On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
  Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!


MMMCDLXXXI - "INYOURGLASSAND"

  I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  You see how all conditions, how all minds,
  Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
  Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  An old man, broken with the storms of state,
  She prizes not such trifles as these are:
  So long as youth and thou are of one date;
  And when the morning sun shall raise his car
  Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
  Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?


MMMCDLXXXII - "THEREAPPEARSAF"

  To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
  Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
  Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
  Procure me music ready when he wakes,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  And wait the season and observe the times
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  And say it is the queen and her allies
  For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.


MMMCDLXXXIII - "ACETHATOVERGOE"

  Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
  Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
  O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
  Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMCDLXXXIV - "SMYBLUNTINVENT"

  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell
  Let me give light, but let me not be light;
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
  Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.


MMMCDLXXXV - "IONQUITEDULLIN"

  I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
  O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
  The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
  Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.


MMMCDLXXXVI - "GMYLINESANDDOI"

  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
  Your master wed me to: nothing but death
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  And on that day at noon whereon he says
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?


MMMCDLXXXVII - "NGMEDISGRACEWE"

  No one but he should be about the king;
  God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
  My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
  Speak it again, and, even with the word,
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMCDLXXXVIII - "REITNOTSINFULT"

  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  In whose comparison all whites are ink,
  Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  On Saturday we will return to France.
  This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  For ever and for ever shall be yours.
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
  To save her life, I'll say she is not so.


MMMCDLXXXIX - "HENSTRIVINGTOM"

  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Should be without regard: what's done is done.
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  I cannot joy, until I be resolved
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  I cannot speak enough of this content;
  Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  Give me some ink and paper in my tent
  This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  May deem that you are worthily deposed.


MMMCDXC - "ENDTOMARTHESUB"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
  Drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
  The strongest body shall it make most weak,
  O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
  My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
  And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Too little payment for so great a debt.
  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  But how long shall that title 'ever' last?


MMMCDXCI - "JECTTHATBEFORE"

  Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
  Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  He is return'd in his opinions; which
  And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMCDXCII - "WASWELLFORTONO"

  Will I with wine and wassail so convince
  And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
  So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
  When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;
  Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
  Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,
  Of physiognomy might one behold!
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
  O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  O heavy times, begetting such events!


MMMCDXCIII - "OTHERPASSMYVER"

  Of what a monarchy you are the head:
  That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
  Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
  Am I a queen in title and in style,
  See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,
  She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!


MMMCDXCIV - "SESTENDTHANOFY"

  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  To give the onset to thy good advice.
  He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.


MMMCDXCV - "OURGRACESANDYO"

  O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
  And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
  Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
  And he himself confess'd but even now
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!


MMMCDXCVI - "URGIFTSTOTELLA"

  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  Richly in two short hours. Only they
  Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
  I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
  For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
  That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.
  Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
  The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
  Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  Let me give light, but let me not be light;
  A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.


MMMCDXCVII - "NDMOREMUCHMORE"

  Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  My soul and body to the skies and ground;
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
  He sought to murder: but her better stars
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.


MMMCDXCVIII - "THANINMYVERSEC"

  The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
  Hath willingly departed with a part,
  Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
  Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
  Yea the illiterate, that know not how
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  So you, to study now it is too late,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  CORIOLANUS!


MMMCDXCIX - "ANSITYOUROWNGL"

  All murders past do stand excused in this:
  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
  She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
  I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
  Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
  With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.


MMMD - "ASSSHOWSYOUWHE"

  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
  He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
  Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
  He makes me angry with him; for he seems
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMDI - "NYOULOOKINITTO"

  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
  O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
  Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
  Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
  If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
  Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
  It seems then that the tidings of this broil
  To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
  That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
  Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.


MMMDII - "MEFAIRFRIENDYO"

  May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
  I'll throw thy body in another room
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Firm and irrevocable is my doom
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
  You are transported by calamity
  Of our restored love and amity.


MMMDIII - "UNEVERCANBEOLD"

  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  And all to have the noble duke alive.
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?


MMMDIV - "FORASYOUWEREWH"

  Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  And with a larger tether may he walk
  So near with their lips that their breaths embraced
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!


MMMDV - "ENFIRSTYOUREYE"

  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
  It lifted up it head and did address
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
  That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMDVI - "IEYEDSUCHSEEMS"

  If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,
  See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
  Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
  He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
  Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
  Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.


MMMDVII - "YOURBEAUTYSTIL"

  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.


MMMDVIII - "LTHREEWINTERSC"

  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,
  His body will I bear unto the king:
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?


MMMDIX - "OLDHAVEFROMTHE"

  Only, good master, while we do admire
  Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
  And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Of all the gentry; for the most part such
  Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
  To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
  How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMDX - "FORESTSSHOOKTH"

  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
  Here is my hand for my true constancy;
  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
  O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  The very bottom and the soul of hope,
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.


MMMDXI - "REESUMMERSPRID"

  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
  Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
  Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.


MMMDXII - "ETHREEBEAUTEOU"

  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
  He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.


MMMDXIII - "SSPRINGSTOYELL"

  So mighty and so many my defects,
  Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  If they were his assistants, yea or no;
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
  To gratulate the gentle princes there.
  O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Lest we remember still that we have none.
  Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.


MMMDXIV - "OWAUTUMNTURNDI"

  Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
  Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
  A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
  Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
  To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Now do I long to hear how you were found;
  Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
  I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?


MMMDXV - "NPROCESSOFTHES"

  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
  Possessing or pursuing no delight,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Of this proud king, who studies day and night
  Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  This fair alliance quickly shall call home
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Sticking together in calamity.


MMMDXVI - "EASONSHAVEISEE"

  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  Sits not so easy on me as you think.
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
  Something I must do to procure me grace.
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMMDXVII - "NTHREEAPRILPER"

  Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
  Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
  How merited to be so; since he came,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And if we did but glance a far-off look,
  Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  It is an attribute to God himself;
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMDXVIII - "FUMESINTHREEHO"

  Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
  I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
  To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
  How many be commanded that command!
  Replies her husband: 'do not take away
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?


MMMDXIX - "TJUNESBURNDSIN"

  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
  Base men by his endowments are made great.
  Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
  No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.


MMMDXX - "CEFIRSTISAWYOU"

  Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  For we will fetters put upon this fear,
  I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
  Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
  What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?
  You have the honey still, but these the gall;
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.


MMMDXXI - "FRESHWHICHYETA"

  Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
  We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
  How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
  He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
  You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  That only to stand high in your account,
  And should you fall, he as the next will mount.


MMMDXXII - "REGREENAHYETDO"

  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
  Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  To tell you once again that at my birth
  Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
  Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.


MMMDXXIII - "THBEAUTYLIKEAD"

  Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
  He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
  Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
  The times are wild; contention, like a horse
  You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
  Death, death; O amiable lovely death!


MMMDXXIV - "IALHANDSTEALFR"

  I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
  And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
  Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  For, if I should as lion come in strife
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!


MMMDXXV - "OMHISFIGUREAND"

  On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
  My liege, your highness now may do me good.
  He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
  I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
  She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  As far as doth the Capitol exceed
  No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
  Did never traitor in the land commit.


MMMDXXVI - "NOPACEPERCEIVE"

  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us;
  And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
  Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  I am about to weep; but, thinking that
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMDXXVII - "DSOYOURSWEETHU"

  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
  Who is the second that presents himself?
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.


MMMDXXVIII - "EWHICHMETHINKS"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Within the eye of honour, be assured,
  Have I not heard these islanders shout out
  I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
  Have I once lived to see two honest men?
  Might go one way, and safely; and the end
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
  Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
  I wonder now how yonder city stands
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Know I these men that come along with you?
  Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.


MMMDXXIX - "STILLDOTHSTAND"

  Some one be ready with a costly suit,
  The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
  I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
  They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
  Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
  Supposing it a thing impossible-
  This his good melancholy oft began,
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.


MMMDXXX - "HATHMOTIONANDM"

  His love, perceiving how he is enraged,
  As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
  Than honesty to honesty engaged,
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
  Only to flatter fools and make them bold:
  Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
  If what in rest you have in right you hold,
  Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
  Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
  Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.


MMMDXXXI - "INEEYEMAYBEDEC"

  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
  And when the morning sun shall raise his car
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
  Besides I say and will in battle prove,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.


MMMDXXXII - "EIVEDFORFEAROF"

  England, impatient of your just demands,
  I grant I am a woman; but withal
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.
  Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  From my remembrance. And, besides, the king
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
  Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  From whence with life he never more sprung up.


MMMDXXXIII - "WHICHHEARTHIST"

  What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
  In the seat royal of this famous isle?
  Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
  Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
  Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  At last she thus begins: 'Thou worthy lord
  Robs me of that which not enriches him
  The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  I will, if that my fading breath permit
  Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
  There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.


MMMDXXXIV - "HOUAGEUNBREDER"

  How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
  Or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  And utters it again when God doth please:
  Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Upon the love and truth and vows which I
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMDXXXV - "EYOUWEREBORNWA"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Upon the left hand of the even field.
  With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
  Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,
  Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!


MMMDXXXVI - "SBEAUTYSSUMMER"

  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.
  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
  The dauntless spirit of resolution.
  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Sentenced and stay upon execution.
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
  Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMDXXXVII - "DEADLETNOTMYLO"

  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
  To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
  Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.


MMMDXXXVIII - "VEBECALLDIDOLA"

  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Base men, that use them to so base effect!
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,
  As the death-bed whereon it must expire
  Let all the number of the stars give light
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!
  In me at once: but to the brightest beams
  Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
  O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  And all my pains is sorted to no proof.


MMMDXXXIX - "TRYNORMYBELOVE"

  The violence of either thee becomes,
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
  Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  My army but a weak and sickly guard;
  Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
  Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMDXL - "DASANIDOLSHOWS"

  Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
  And you an officer fit for the place.
  Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
  And not a man of them shall have the grace,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Intended or committed was this fault?
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  Or in my life what comfort, when I am
  Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
  Should be to be protected like a child.


MMMDXLI - "INCEALLALIKEMY"

  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
  Can you not see? or will ye not observe
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  Like men born to renown by life or death.
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  And with his former title greet Macbeth.
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
  Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
  Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.


MMMDXLII - "SONGSANDPRAISE"

  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.
  And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
  Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  At large discourse, while here they do remain.
  Into a bush; under which bush's shade
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMDXLIII - "SBETOONEOFONES"

  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Behold another day break in the east:
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
  Our business valued, some twelve days hence
  Or the light loss of England for a friend:
  No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:
  Only compound me with forgotten dust;
  None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Sticking together in calamity.


MMMDXLIV - "TILLSUCHANDEVE"

  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
  Let York be regent; I will yield to him.
  Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
  So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
  Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
  And Somerset another goodly mast?
  No, no, men living flatter those that die.
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMDXLV - "RSOKINDISMYLOV"

  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
  I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
  I see a better state to me belongs
  She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
  My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
  Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
  Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


MMMDXLVI - "ETODAYTOMORROW"

  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  There stay until the twelve celestial signs
  O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
  And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
  Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
  Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
  Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;
  My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
  Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Was I a child to fear I know not what.


MMMDXLVII - "KINDSTILLCONST"

  Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
  I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
  No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  Since his exile she hath despised me most,
  That yarely frame the office. From the barge
  I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
  Limit each leader to his several charge,
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
  Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.


MMMDXLVIII - "ANTINAWONDROUS"

  As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
  No less in pity than his glory which
  That sin by him advantage should achieve
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
  Or, if I live, is it not very like,
  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
  Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.


MMMDXLIX - "EXCELLENCETHER"

  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
 eXempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Could force his soul so to his own conceit
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Canonized and worshipped as a saint,
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
  Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.


MMMDL - "EFOREMYVERSETO"

  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  For he that steeps his safety in true blood
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
  Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
  Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!


MMMDLI - "CONSTANCYCONFI"

  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
  The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
  And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
  You understand me- over and beside
  Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
  Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
  For what I will, I will, and there an end.
  I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.


MMMDLII - "NEDONETHINGEXP"

  No less in pity than his glory which
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
  Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
  Hostility and civil tumult reigns
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  Either of king or council, when you went
 eXcels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.


MMMDLIII - "RESSINGLEAVESO"

  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Exceed account; but the full sum of me
  Since his exile she hath despised me most,
  Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
  I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
  Losing both beauty and utility.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  And so suppose am I; for in his grave
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
  O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!


MMMDLIV - "UTDIFFERENCEFA"

  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
  Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  It shows my earnestness of affection-
  For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
  Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
  A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.


MMMDLV - "IRKINDANDTRUEI"

  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  If you had sent but two hours before,--
  Neither regarding that she is my child
  Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
  The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.


MMMDLVI - "SALLMYARGUMENT"

  So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
  Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
  Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
  Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
  And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  Therefore accept such kindness as I can.


MMMDLVII - "FAIRKINDANDTRU"

  From this time forth I never will speak word.
  And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
  It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
  Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  This love of theirs myself have often seen,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?


MMMDLVIII - "EVARYINGTOOTHE"

  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
  If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?


MMMDLIX - "RWORDSANDINTHI"

  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  So is it in the music of men's lives.
  Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
  Not by might master'd but by special grace:
  That I account them blessings; for by these
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  I take my leave with many thousand thanks.


MMMDLX - "SCHANGEISMYINV"

  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
  Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
  Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
  Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  May yet ere night yield both my life and them
  You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMMDLXI - "ENTIONSPENTTHR"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  That things ill-got had ever bad success?
  In at his window; set this up with wax
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMDLXII - "EETHEMESINONEW"

  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  If case some one of you would fly from us,
  Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Which was so strongly urged past my defence.


MMMDLXIII - "HICHWONDROUSSC"

  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  Of all treasons, we still see them reveal
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
  Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.


MMMDLXIV - "OPEAFFORDSFAIR"

  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
  For my profession's sacred from above:
  For that he colour'd with his high estate,
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Disgracing of these colours that I wear
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
  And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
  If we do fear this body hath a tail
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MMMDLXV - "KINDANDTRUEHAV"

  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.
  Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
  Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
  And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
  Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,

  To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MMMDLXVI - "EOFTENLIVEDALO"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  For more uneven and unwelcome news
  Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
  I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
  And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!


MMMDLXVII - "NEWHICHTHREETI"

  No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
  How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
  To take him in the purging of his soul,
  He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
  In a light. Yet you see how this world goes.


MMMDLXVIII - "LLNOWNEVERKEPT"

  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  When the one pure, the other made divine?
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
  Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
  There's nothing differs but the outward fame.


MMMDLXIX - "SEATINONEWHENI"

  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
  That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
  I have from their confines call'd to enact
  Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Into this gaping hollow of the earth?


MMMDLXX - "NTHECHRONICLEO"

  No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
  To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
  His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
  Consider who the king your father sends,
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!


MMMDLXXI - "FWASTEDTIMEISE"

  For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
  We have at disadvantage fought and did
  And my pretext to strike at him admits
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  That highly may advantage thee to hear:
  I have done penance for contemning Love,
  Make the young old, the old become a child.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMDLXXII - "EDESCRIPTIONSO"

  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
  Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  This doth not so, for she divideth us:
  Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
  Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
  Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
  Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.


MMMDLXXIII - "FTHEFAIRESTWIG"

  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
  And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,
  I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  To have my praise for this, perform a part
  Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
  It is not for your health thus to commit
  God pardon them that are the cause of it!


MMMDLXXIV - "HTSANDBEAUTYMA"

  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
  Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
  Became the next day's master, till the last
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
  Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
  The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
  You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
  May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
  And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.


MMMDLXXV - "KINGBEAUTIFULO"

  Knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
  I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
  Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
  Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
  But more for that in low simplicity
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  The English army is grown weak and faint:
  If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
  Full of vexation come I, with complaint
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.


MMMDLXXVI - "LDRHYMEINPRAIS"

  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
  You make strong party, or defend yourself
  Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
  Nor can imagination form a shape,
  Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
  I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.


MMMDLXXVII - "EOFLADIESDEADA"

  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Of either's colour was the other queen,
  For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
  Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
  As I all other in all worths surmount.


MMMDLXXVIII - "NDLOVELYKNIGHT"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Doth any name particular belong
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
  Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
  How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.


MMMDLXXIX - "STHENINTHEBLAZ"

  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  To make more vent for passage of her breath;
  Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
  If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
  That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  But like of each thing that in season grows.
  Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
  And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
  Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.


MMMDLXXX - "ONOFSWEETBEAUT"

  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  For I should melt at an offender's tears,
  Some that will thank you, making just report
  When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  To tread a measure with her on this grass.
  Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?


MMMDLXXXI - "YSBESTOFHANDOF"

  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
  This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  For, look you, I may make the belly smile
  Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
  And never rise until my tears and prayers
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
  On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
  For thou hast done a charitable deed.


MMMDLXXXII - "FOOTOFLIPOFEYE"

  For our best act. If we shall stand still,
  O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
  Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
  Let me be blest to make this happy close;
  Indeed the top of admiration! worth
  Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
  O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMDLXXXIII - "OFBROWISEETHEI"

  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Weigh what convenience both of time and means
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.


MMMDLXXXIV - "RANTIQUEPENWOU"

  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  And shall have your will, because our king:
  Now does my project gather to a head:
  Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
  I gave it freely ever; and there's none
  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Upon the right and party of her son?
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
  Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
  Unto the legions on the other side.


MMMDLXXXV - "LDHAVEEXPRESSD"

  Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
  Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
 eXcept to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
  Drove back again unto my native clime?


MMMDLXXXVI - "EVENSUCHABEAUT"

  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
  But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.


MMMDLXXXVII - "YASYOUMASTERNO"

  You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
  And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
  So many hours must I tend my flock;
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
  And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.


MMMDLXXXVIII - "WSOALLTHEIRPRA"

  When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
  Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
  Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
  Limit each leader to his several charge,
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  He calls me to a restitution large
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.


MMMDLXXXIX - "ISESAREBUTPROP"

  Into the purse of rich prosperity
  Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  And with his former title greet Macbeth.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.


MMMDXC - "HECIESOFTHISOU"

  He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
  In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Since I am crept in favour with myself,
  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  For Brutus only overcame himself,
  Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  I think his understanding is bereft.
  Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.


MMMDXCI - "RTIMEALLYOUPRE"

  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  To none of these, except it be the last;
  I lost my liberty and they their lives.
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
  Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
  Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMDXCII - "FIGURINGANDFOR"

  For what they have not, that which they possess
  I think his understanding is bereft.
  Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
  Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  I'll send them all as willing as I live:
  Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
  Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:
  Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
  Not, black angel; I have no food for thee.
  Devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
  For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.


MMMDXCIII - "THEYLOOKDBUTWI"

  Then white as lawn, the roses took away.
  How this foul rout began, who set it on;
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
  Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  King Henry's peers and chief nobility
  Diana's temple is not distant far,
  Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
  When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
  I have some private schooling for you both.


MMMDXCIV - "THDIVININGEYES"

  The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
  He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
  If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  If best were as it was, or best without.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  I saw him in the battle range about;
  Not possible; for who shall bear your part
  Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!


MMMDXCV - "THEYHADNOTSKIL"

  That brought her for this high good turn so far?
  He will return; and hope I may that she,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
  He entertain'd a show so seeming just,
  And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  O, but I love his lady too too much,
  The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
  Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
  Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
  If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.


MMMDXCVI - "LENOUGHYOURWOR"

  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
  Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  Who was the first of Britain which did put
  On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MMMDXCVII - "THTOSINGFORWEW"

  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.
  Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
  The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
  If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
  No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
  Go then; and with a countenance as clear
  From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Want wit in all one word to understand.


MMMDXCVIII - "HICHNOWBEHOLDT"

  He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Not changing heart with habit, I am still
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
  But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  He left a promise to return again
  Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
  Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,
  Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.


MMMDXCIX - "HESEPRESENTDAY"

  How far into the morning is it, lords?
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  She was a vixen when she went to school;
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  To make that only true we now intend,
  Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
  As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.


MMMDC - "SHADEYESTOWOND"

  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  Her ashes new create another heir,
  A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
  Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  The boy gives warning something doth approach.
  Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
  Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  Now, the Lord lighten thee! Thou art a great
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?


MMMDCI - "ERBUTLACKTONGU"

  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
  But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
  The service that I truly did his life
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  As in revenge or quittal of such strife:
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
  The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
  Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
  Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.


MMMDCII - "ESTOPRAISENOTM"

  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
  I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
  Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Now serves the season that they may surprise
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.


MMMDCIII - "INEOWNFEARSNOR"

  If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
  Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  When time is broke and no proportion kept!
  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Am I a queen in title and in style,
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MMMDCIV - "THEPROPHETICSO"

  This but begins the woe, others must end.
  He is a great observer and he looks
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.
  Remember since you owed no more to time
  Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
  Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
  Have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
  Created, for his rare success in arms,
  Stephano is my name; and I bring word
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.


MMMDCV - "ULOFTHEWIDEWOR"

  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
  For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
  Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
  If any be, the trespass of the queen.
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  What further woe conspires against mine age?
  Of disobedient opposition
  Remember so weak a composition.


MMMDCVI - "LDDREAMINGONTH"

  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
  Most necessary 'tis that we forget
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  God and his angels guard your sacred throne
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Now must I to the monument alone;
  They burn in indignation. I repent:
  Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.


MMMDCVII - "INGSTOCOMECANY"

  I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
  Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
  Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
  Create her child of spleen, that it may live
  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
  My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
  And cannot brook competitors in love?
  Now entertain conjecture of a time
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.


MMMDCVIII - "ETTHELEASEOFMY"

  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  To carry that which I would have refused,
  These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  For I am almost ready to dissolve,
  Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!


MMMDCIX - "TRUELOVECONTRO"

  The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
  Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  Or, being open, put into his hands
  Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.


MMMDCX - "LSUPPOSEDASFOR"

  Like usury, applying wet to wet,
  Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  Particular addition. from the bill
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Disguise the holy strength of their command,
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
  For I must think of that which company
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.


MMMDCXI - "FEITTOACONFINE"

  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
  The father of this seeming lady and
  Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
  Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
  Of such contents as you will wonder at;
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  For we have nothing else to ask, but that
  I am your better, traitors as ye are:
  No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMDCXII - "DDOOMTHEMORTAL"

  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
  To spend that shortness basely were too long,
  He would not stay at your petitions: made
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Make not too rash a trial of him, for
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
  And such a wall, as I would have you think,
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!


MMMDCXIII - "MOONHATHHERECL"

  More fierce and more inexorable far
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
  And least proportion of humanity:
  That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
  Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Come from the north; and as I came along
  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.


MMMDCXIV - "IPSEENDUREDAND"

  I cannot think my sister in the least
  Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Now, messenger, what letters or what news
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.


MMMDCXV - "THESADAUGURSMO"

  They might have lived to bear and he to taste
  Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
  And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
  Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
  And, after conflict such as was supposed
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Matter against me; and his eye reviled
  O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!


MMMDCXVI - "CKTHEIROWNPRES"

  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  Than ever at one time the clergy yet
  He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
  Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.


MMMDCXVII - "AGEINCERTAINTI"

  Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
  Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  I could have well diverted her intents,
  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
  Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
  A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  The evil that men do lives after them;
  I would be so triumphant as I am?


MMMDCXVIII - "ESNOWCROWNTHEM"

  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  So honour cross it from the north to south,
  Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
  O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
  Who is it that can tell me who I am?
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  War-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
  Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
  Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
  His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!


MMMDCXIX - "SELVESASSUREDA"

  Saving your merry humour, here's the note
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
  Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!


MMMDCXX - "NDPEACEPROCLAI"

  No better a musician than the wren.
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
  Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  A thousand times, and now no more reflect;
  In brief, sir, study what you most affect.


MMMDCXXI - "MSOLIVESOFENDL"

  Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
  So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;
  For you all; you have horses for yourselves:
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.


MMMDCXXII - "ESSAGENOWWITHT"

  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Supposing it a thing impossible-
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  Never to part with it; and here he stands;
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  What then remains, we being thus arrived
  Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  To spoil the city and your royal court.
  Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
  The English are embattled, you French peers.


MMMDCXXIII - "HEDROPSOFTHISM"

  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
  Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
  Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
  For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
  To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
  She would not lose it: her attendants are
  Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!


MMMDCXXIV - "OSTBALMYTIMEMY"

  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
  Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
  To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
  And better conquest never canst thou make
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
  You know no more than others; but you frame
  The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
  Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.


MMMDCXXV - "LOVELOOKSFRESH"

  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
  For he's no man on whom perfections wait
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.


MMMDCXXVI - "ANDDEATHTOMESU"

  All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
  Not Hermia but Helena I love:
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Do you set down your name in the scroll of
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And by the hazard of the spotted die
  This honourable bounty shall belong:
  He gives me so much of mine own, as I
  Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
  Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
  Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Shall then my father's will be of no force
  Unto a lineal true-derived course.


MMMDCXXVII - "BSCRIBESSINCES"

  Base men, that use them to so base effect!
  Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
  Can justly praise but what he does affect:
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  If that from him there may be aught applied
  But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  I do entreat you, not a man depart,
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.


MMMDCXXVIII - "PITEOFHIMILLLI"

  Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
  Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  For treason is but trusted like the fox,
  His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
  I have the placing of the British crown.


MMMDCXXIX - "VEINTHISPOORRH"

  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  I will upon all hazards well believe
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Though standing naked on a mountain top,
  Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
  Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  One poor retiring minute in an age
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?


MMMDCXXX - "YMEWHILEHEINSU"

  You are transported by calamity
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  England and France might, through their amity,
  With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
  Her inclination, let him not leave out
  I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
  Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
  Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.


MMMDCXXXI - "LTSOERDULLANDS"

  Loather a hundred times to part than die.
  The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
  Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
  O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.


MMMDCXXXII - "PEECHLESSTRIBE"

  Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  I like this fair proceeding of the King's.
  But your request shall make me let it pass.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMDCXXXIII - "SANDTHOUINTHIS"

  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
  All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  That,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  Unless you call it good to pity him,
  I do not greatly care to be deceived,
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
  This is not strong enough to be believed
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
  Still and contemplative in living art.


MMMDCXXXIV - "SHALTFINDTHYMO"

  So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
  How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  That winter lion, who in rage forgets
  From first to last, the onset and retire
  I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  You holy clergymen, is there no plot
  Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.


MMMDCXXXV - "NUMENTWHENTYRA"

  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
  Make you to ravel all this matter out,
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
  Thy private feasting to a public fast,
  Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  These banish'd men that I have kept withal
  You have your wish; my will is even this:
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  And yet methinks I do not like this tune.


MMMDCXXXVI - "NTSCRESTSANDTO"

  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  Thou never shalt hear herald any more.
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
  The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
  Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
  And urge her to a present answer back:
  Not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
  Deny their office: only you do lack
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!


MMMDCXXXVII - "MBSOFBRASSARES"

  Men would carry coals. They would have me as
  But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
  She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  For when we rage, advice is often seen
  By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Set down, set down your honourable load,
  And rob in the behalf of charity.
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Since I must lose the use of all deceit?


MMMDCXXXVIII - "PENTWHATSINTHE"

  Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
  Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'
  Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
  The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
  Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
  Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
  Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMDCXXXIX - "BRAINTHATINKMA"

  Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  In whose comparison all whites are ink,
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  Adonis painted by a running brook,
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
  No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
  Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
  My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!


MMMDCXL - "YCHARACTERWHIC"

  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
  Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
  The king is merciful, if you revolt.
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
  He should not humour me. I will this night,
  I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
  Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.


MMMDCXLI - "HHATHNOTFIGURE"

  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Here in this city visiting the sick,
  All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  He only lived but till he was a man;
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
  For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
  I put myself to thy direction, and
  God and his angels guard your sacred throne
  Upon my head and all this famous land.
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMDCXLII - "DTOTHEEMYTRUES"

  Do the part of an honest man in it.
  To the succeeding royalty he leaves
  O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  More than the nature of a brother's love!
  Your right depends not on his life or death.
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!


MMMDCXLIII - "PIRITWHATSNEWT"

  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
  Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
  A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.
  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
  That,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.


MMMDCXLIV - "OSPEAKWHATNEWT"

  O any thing, of nothing first create!
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  And presently repair to Crosby Place;
  Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
  Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
  Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
  As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
  The king hath note of all that they intend,
  Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
  The king hath many marching in his coats.


MMMDCXLV - "OREGISTERTHATM"

  O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  If he do break the smallest particle
  Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
  There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  To have her back return'd: thus to persist
  Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
  And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
  That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
  Most honourably doth unhold his word.


MMMDCXLVI - "AYEXPRESSMYLOV"

  Art thou not second woman in the realm,
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
 eXampled by the first pace that is sick
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
  Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  You thief of love! what, have you come by night
  Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.


MMMDCXLVII - "EORTHYDEARMERI"

  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  I see, as in a map, the end of all.


MMMDCXLVIII - "TNOTHINGSWEETB"

  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
  The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
  Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
  I'll be damned for never a king's son in
  Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  Give me superfluous death.  A noise within.
  Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
  Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  To set a form upon desired change,
  But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.


MMMDCXLIX - "OYBUTYETLIKEPR"

  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
  Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
  Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
  Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMDCL - "AYERSDIVINEIMU"

  As patches set upon a little breach
  Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Did this companion with the saffron face
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  I will be thine; and till that instant shut
  Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?


MMMDCLI - "STEACHDAYSAYOE"

  Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
  This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
  Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
  His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
  As patches set upon a little breach
  Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMDCLII - "RTHEVERYSAMECO"

  Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
  She never yet was foolish that was fair;
  And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
  My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
  On what submissive message art thou sent?


MMMDCLIII - "UNTINGNOOLDTHI"

  Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
  Nor the division of a battle knows
  Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.
  Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Let those who are in favour with their stars
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.


MMMDCLIV - "NGOLDTHOUMINEI"

  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
  Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
  The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
  His servant live, and will his vassal die:
  Of thy nativity! I would the milk
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
  If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
  Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!


MMMDCLV - "THINEEVENASWHE"

  The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
  He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  And on to-morrow, bid them march away.
  Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
  Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
  How will my wife for slaughter of my son
  Expecting in return twenty for one?


MMMDCLVI - "NFIRSTIHALLOWD"

  None wed the second but who killed the first.
  Follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
  I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
  The confident and over-lusty French
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.


MMMDCLVII - "THYFAIRNAMESOT"

  To your protection I commend me, gods.
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
  Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
  Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
  After the last enchantment you did here,
  I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
  To ask the spotted princess how she fares.


MMMDCLVIII - "HATETERNALLOVE"

  He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him
  And see the cities and the towns defaced
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  That no man enter till my tale be done.
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  All France will be replete with mirth and joy,
  Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
  Of this most fair occasion, by the which
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMDCLIX - "INLOVESFRESHCA"

  I am left out; for me nothing remains.
  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  She answers him as if she knew his mind:
  For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Save what is had or must from you be took.
  Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
  Clarence hath not another day to live:
  And your sweet semblance to some other give.


MMMDCLX - "SEWEIGHSNOTTHE"

  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  I shall obey you in all fair commands.
  Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  So fair an outward and such stuff within
  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
  O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
  To have his pomp and all what state compounds
  That we the horrider may seem to those
  How well my comfort is revived by this!
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MMMDCLXI - "DUSTANDINJURYO"

  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
  The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
  Delivers in such apt and gracious words
  I would detain you here some month or two
  Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?
  Join we together, for the public good,
  Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
  O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!


MMMDCLXII - "FAGENORGIVESTO"

  From the most gracious regent of this land,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
  Thus will I fold them one on another:
  Of what degree soever, with his brother.


MMMDCLXIII - "NECESSARYWRINK"

  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  I hear it by the way; but I will send:
  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.


MMMDCLXIV - "LESPLACEBUTMAK"

  Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Surely, by all the glory you have won,
  Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
  Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  But this effusion of such manly drops,
  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
  The satin for my short cloak and my slops?
  Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.
  And such a piece of service will you do,
  Know I these men that come along with you?


MMMDCLXV - "ESANTIQUITYFOR"

  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
  Quake in the present winter's state and wish
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  It will the woefullest division prove
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MMMDCLXVI - "AYEHISPAGEFIND"

  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
  Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
  If any noise or soldier you perceive
  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  Please it your majesty to give me leave,
  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Found that the issue was not his begot;
  I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
  Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
  Does by their own insinuation grow.


MMMDCLXVII - "INGTHEFIRSTCON"

  If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Go quick away; the story of my life
  Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
  I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
  Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
  Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
  There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
  Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.


MMMDCLXVIII - "CEITOFLOVETHER"

  Can you not see? or will ye not observe
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
  Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
  Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
  Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That I may know the let, why gentle Peace
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.


MMMDCLXIX - "EBREDWHERETIME"

  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Will I with wine and wassail so convince
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  That ever yet this land was guilty of.
  In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
  Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMMDCLXX - "ANDOUTWARDFORM"

  As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
  Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
  Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  The accident which brought me to her eye
  When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
  And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Did to his predecessors part withal.
  For in my death I murder shameful scorn:
  Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.


MMMDCLXXI - "WOULDSHOWITDEA"

  Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
  Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
  Spur post, and get before him to the king,
  How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Who bids them still consort with ugly night,
  If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
  That, being captain of the watch to-night,
  Did will what he did spend and spent not that
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  And you that love the commons, follow me.


MMMDCLXXII - "DONEVERSAYTHAT"

  Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  Seeming to bury that posterity
  And nothing can or shall content my soul
  You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,
  Although not valued to the money's worth.
  To work exceeding miracles on earth.


MMMDCLXXIII - "IWASFALSEOFHEA"

  Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
  Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
  And being seated, and domestic broils
  She's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
  For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
  Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  On Tuesday last to listen after news.
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
  He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.


MMMDCLXXIV - "RTTHOUGHABSENC"

  Religious in mine error, I adore
  That can I witness; and a fouler fact
  Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
  How shall we then dispense with that contract,
  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
  But am in that dimension grossly clad
  She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
  Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.


MMMDCLXXV - "ESEEMDMYFLAMET"

  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
  Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
  Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
  And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
  Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.


MMMDCLXXVI - "OQUALIFYASEASY"

  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Question, my lords, no further of the case,
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  I will your very faithful feeder be,
  For I have served him, and the man commands
  You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
  And he the burden of a guilty mind.
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.


MMMDCLXXVII - "MIGHTIFROMMYSE"

  Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  I came unto your court for honour's cause,
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
  Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  Step forth mine advocate; at your request
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMDCLXXVIII - "LFDEPARTASFROM"

  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
  And would have kept so long as breath did last!
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
  And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
  So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
  From him that fled some strange indignity,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.


MMMDCLXXIX - "MYSOULWHICHINT"

  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  You do not hold the method to enforce
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
  With tristful visage, as against the doom,
  How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
  In having known no travel in his youth.
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.


MMMDCLXXX - "HYBREASTDOTHLI"

  Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
  You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
  By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
  So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
  Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
  However God or fortune cast my lot,
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.


MMMDCLXXXI - "ETHATISMYHOMEO"

  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  The strongest body shall it make most weak,
  He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
  And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
  Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
  Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
  You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
  How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
  Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!


MMMDCLXXXII - "FLOVEIFIHAVERA"

  For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  Of a glad father compass thee about!
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.
  His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
  And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
  A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.


MMMDCLXXXIII - "NGEDLIKEHIMTHA"

  No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
  Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  Intends his journey; and within three days
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
  Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
  A local habitation and a name.


MMMDCLXXXIV - "TTRAVELSIRETUR"

  The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
  Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  To tell him that his sword can never win
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.


MMMDCLXXXV - "NAGAINJUSTTOTH"

  Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
  And laboured all I could to do him right;
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  And say if I shall see you soon at night.
  Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
  Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
  Joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  See to my house, left in the fearful guard
  Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
  That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?


MMMDCLXXXVI - "ETIMENOTWITHTH"

  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  I will converse with iron-witted fools
  Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  What might you think? No, I went round to work
  Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!


MMMDCLXXXVII - "ETIMEEXCHANGED"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
  Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
 eXceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
  Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
  And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
  Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
  Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.


MMMDCLXXXVIII - "SOTHATMYSELFBR"

  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
  They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
  Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Less impudence to gainsay what they did
  For false forswearing and for murder too:
  But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


MMMDCLXXXIX - "INGWATERFORMYS"

  I know you think to dine with me to-day,
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
  When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  To blot old books and alter their contents,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  On us thou canst not enter but by death;
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
  Still live they and for ever may they last!


MMMDCXC - "TAINNEVERBELIE"

  To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
  And would you not do much to do them good?
  I can create the rest: virtue and she
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MMMDCXCI - "VETHOUGHINMYNA"

  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.
  Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
  It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
  Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
  Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
  You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  And golden times, and happy news of price.


MMMDCXCII - "TUREREIGNDALLF"

  The execution of it shall make known.
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  If any in Vienna be of worth
  Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  And from each other look thou lead them thus,
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
  For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?


MMMDCXCIII - "RAILTIESTHATBE"

  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
  I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
  It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
  Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
  How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
  And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
  Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


MMMDCXCIV - "SIEGEALLKINDSO"

  Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
  I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
  Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
  If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
  Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?


MMMDCXCV - "FBLOODTHATITCO"

  For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
  Being once perfected how to grant suits,
  Let us assail the family of York.
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  And make my image but an alehouse sign.
  To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
  I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
  Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
  Could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
  O any thing, of nothing first create!


MMMDCXCVI - "ULDSOPREPOSTER"

  Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
  Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,
  Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
  Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
  Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
  To think their dolour others have endured.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMDCXCVII - "OUSLYBESTAINDT"

  O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  The violence of either thee becomes,
  And of so easy and so plain a stop
  I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
  Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.


MMMDCXCVIII - "OLEAVEFORNOTHI"

  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
  Half of the number that King Priam had,
  I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.


MMMDCXCIX - "NGALLTHYSUMOFG"

  Next month? and are they not some of them set
  Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
  And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  Unless he take the course that you have done,
  Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
  One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
  For when we rage, advice is often seen
  Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.


MMMDCC - "OODFORNOTHINGT"

  On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
  O masters, if I were disposed to stir
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
  The king with mighty and quick-raised power
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  That dims the honour of this warlike isle!


MMMDCCI - "HISWIDEUNIVERS"

  Happy in this, she is not yet so old
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Speak to the people, and they pity her.


MMMDCCII - "EICALLSAVETHOU"

  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
  Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
  A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
  Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
  Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  The very tyranny and rage of his.
  He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
  O good but most unwise patricians! why,
  Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.


MMMDCCIII - "MYROSEINITTHOU"

  My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  O, but remember this another day,
  So please you, let me now be left alone,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Is there no voice more worthy than my own
  Never so weary, never so in woe,
  In having much, torments us with defect
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  That ever ear did hear to such effect:
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.


MMMDCCIV - "ARTMYALLALASTI"

  As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.
  And this neglection of degree it is
  Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
  Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
  Then, were not summer's distillation left,
  I think his understanding is bereft.


MMMDCCV - "STRUEIHAVEGONE"

  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  And, as you answer, I do know the scope
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  Now counting best to be with you alone,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMMDCCVI - "HEREANDTHEREAN"

  How often said, my dignity would last
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  That is to see how deep my grave is made;
  Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MMMDCCVII - "DMADEMYSELFAMO"

  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
  And bids it leap from thence, where it may find
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  My duty pricks me on to utter that
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
  For more than blushing comes to: if your back
  And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
  My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!


MMMDCCVIII - "TLEYTOTHEVIEWG"

  That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
  Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
  That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
  God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?


MMMDCCIX - "OREDMINEOWNTHO"

  Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  I hope I have your good will, father Page.
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  What would my potent master? here I am.
  Now to deliver her possession up
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
  Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.


MMMDCCX - "UGHTSSOLDCHEAP"

  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.
  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
  So many hours must I tend my flock;
  Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Like men born to renown by life or death.
  Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
  Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
  Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  A thing divine, for nothing natural
  Provokes this deluge most unnatural.


MMMDCCXI - "WHATISMOSTDEAR"

  With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
  He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!
  And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
  Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
  I did present him with the Paris balls.
  So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
  So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MMMDCCXII - "MADEOLDOFFENCE"

  Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
  And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
  Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMDCCXIII - "SOFAFFECTIONSN"

  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
  From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
  And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
  For through this laund anon the deer will come;
  From open haunts and popularity.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
  The other, that he do record a gift,
  Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,
  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.


MMMDCCXIV - "EWMOSTTRUEITIS"

  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
  My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
  That they pass by me as the idle wind,
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  In kissing, do you render or receive?
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
  She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.


MMMDCCXV - "THATIHAVELOOKD"

  That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
  Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,
  Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;
  The unity and married calm of states
  I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
  And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
  Once more let me behold it: is it that
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!


MMMDCCXVI - "ONTRUTHASKANCE"

  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
  However God or fortune cast my lot,
  And we must root him out. From your affairs
  Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
  Knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMDCCXVII - "ANDSTRANGELYBU"

  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
  There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:
  No bargains break that are not this day made:
  Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
  Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
  Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
  Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
  But by self-danger, you should tread a course
  Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.


MMMDCCXVIII - "TBYALLABOVETHE"

  Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
  By whom this great assembly is contrived,
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
  And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
  Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;
  Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
  And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
  Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
  Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  The way which promises assurance; and
  Hath willingly departed with a part,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMDCCXIX - "SEBLENCHESGAVE"

  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Base men, that use them to so base effect!
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
  Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
  As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMDCCXX - "MYHEARTANOTHER"

  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
  Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  All my abilities in thy behalf.
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
  He was not taken well; he had not dined:
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MMMDCCXXI - "YOUTHANDWORSEE"

  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  There let them bide until we have devised
  Her brother is in secret come from France;
  And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
  Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMMDCCXXII - "SSAYSPROVEDTHE"

  Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
  Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
  As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
  Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill;
  Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Or on Diana's altar to protest
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  The very train of her worst wearing gown
  He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?


MMMDCCXXIII - "EMYBESTOFLOVEN"

  England, impatient of your just demands,
  My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
  But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
  O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
  For much imaginary work was there;
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.


MMMDCCXXIV - "OWALLISDONEHAV"

  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
  As well descended as thyself; and hath
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
  I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
  So many days my ewes have been with young;
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  As I belong to worship and affect
  Very hardly upon such a subject.


MMMDCCXXV - "EWHATSHALLHAVE"

  Either of king or council, when you went
  Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
  How can my Muse want subject to invent,
  And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
  That shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
  Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
  And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMDCCXXVI - "NOENDMINEAPPET"

  No more can I be sever'd from your side,
  O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Descended of so many royal kings.
  Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
  It did not speak before. All solemn things
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
  Pinched with the colic, you make faces like
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Than I will wrong such honourable men.


MMMDCCXXVII - "ITEINEVERMOREW"

  In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
  Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?


MMMDCCXXVIII - "ILLGRINDONNEWE"

  It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
  Give me the paper; let me read the same;
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  No one but he should be about the king;
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
  Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth;
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMMDCCXXIX - "RPROOFTOTRYANO"

  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
  O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
  For the remembrance of my father's death.
  There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  There stay until the twelve celestial signs
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  You may as well forbid the mountain pines
  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Of all mad matches, never was the like.


MMMDCCXXX - "LDERFRIENDAGOD"

  Like him that travels I return again,
  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Noble she is, but if she have forgot
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  And I must know it, else he loves me not.
  Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
  Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.


MMMDCCXXXI - "INLOVETOWHOMIA"

  If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
  To none of these, except it be the last;
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.


MMMDCCXXXII - "MCONFINEDTHENG"

  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
  Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  For with the nightly linen that she wears
  I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
  Though their injunction be to bar my doors
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.


MMMDCCXXXIII - "IVEMEWELCOMENE"

  I will from henceforth rather be myself,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  We do; and long to know each other worse.
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
  Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
  My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


MMMDCCXXXIV - "XTMYHEAVENTHEB"

 eXcept a sword or sceptre balance it:
  That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
  Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
  Your brother and his lover have embraced:
  Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  He needs no indirect nor lawless course
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  But shall you on your knowledge find this way?


MMMDCCXXXV - "ESTEVENTOTHYPU"

  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
  To come at first when he doth send for her,
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Not three hours' travel from this very place.
  Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
  O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
  The better that your lordship please to ask.
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  You have a double tongue within your mask,
  Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,
  Upon the very naked name of love.


MMMDCCXXXVI - "REANDMOSTMOSTL"

  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  Did move your greatness and this noble state
  My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
  Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
  Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
  So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?


MMMDCCXXXVII - "OVINGBREASTOFO"

  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
  But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  And these great tears grace his remembrance more
  She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
  Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
  Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
  For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
  Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.


MMMDCCXXXVIII - "RMYSAKEDOYOUWI"

  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
  Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  And this shall free thee from this present shame;
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Of nature and of nations speak aloud
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
  If holy churchmen take delight in broils?


MMMDCCXXXIX - "THFORTUNECHIDE"

  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
  Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
  Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
  I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMDCCXL - "THEGUILTYGODDE"

  That fears his fellowship to die with us.
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  God give us leisure for these rites of love!
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  The kings your ancestors, together with
  Your father's heir must have your father's land.
  Grew a companion to the common streets,
  One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.


MMMDCCXLI - "SSOFMYHARMFULD"

  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:
  Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
  Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
  Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.


MMMDCCXLII - "EEDSTHATDIDNOT"

  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
  That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  If I can catch him once upon the hip,
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  That have their alms out of the empress' chest.


MMMDCCXLIII - "BETTERFORMYLIF"

  Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
  Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Recking as little what betideth me
  Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
  O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.


MMMDCCXLIV - "EPROVIDETHANPU"

  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
  Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
  No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
  Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
  Until the queen his mistress bury it.


MMMDCCXLV - "BLICMEANSWHICH"

  By whose approach the regions of Artois,
  Love? his affections do not that way tend;
  I, now the voice of the recorded law,
  Can any way speak in his just commend;
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
  Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!


MMMDCCXLVI - "PUBLICMANNERSB"

  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
  By strangling thee in her accursed womb
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
  May all the building in my fancy pluck
  And I will wish thee never more to dance,
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  Now, lords, my choler being over-blown
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
  Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.


MMMDCCXLVII - "REEDSTHENCECOM"

  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
  So long in his unlucky Irish wars
  Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
  Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Never was seen so black a day as this:
  Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
  O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
  More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?


MMMDCCXLVIII - "ESITTHATMYNAME"

  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
  I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
  Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
  That promise noble service: and they come
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Another, with his finger and his thumb,
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
  Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  As, not to see a woman in that term,
  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


MMMDCCXLIX - "RECEIVESABRAND"

  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
  Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.


MMMDCCL - "ANDALMOSTTHENC"

  Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
  No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
  The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
  Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
  Here is my hand for my true constancy;
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.


MMMDCCLI - "EMYNATUREISSUB"

  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  You would have been contracted to a maid;
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
  They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  I did not then entreat to have her stay;
  So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
  Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.


MMMDCCLII - "DUEDTOWHATITWO"

  Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  Together with the pitiful complaints
  O, what authority and show of truth
  Which out of daily fortune ever taints
  His rudeness so with his authorized youth
  And from this swarm of fair advantages
  Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
  It is war's prize to take all vantages;
  To trouble and disturb the king and us?
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Or more than any living man could bear.


MMMDCCLIII - "RKSINLIKETHEDY"

  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
  Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
  Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;
  Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
  Know I these men that come along with you?
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
  Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
  You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?


MMMDCCLIV - "ERSHANDPITYMET"

  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Some one take order Buckingham be brought
  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
  Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
  Protest my ears were never better fed
  It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
  My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.


MMMDCCLV - "HENANDWISHIWER"

  His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
  Art thou not second woman in the realm,
  Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
  Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
  Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
  If to have done the thing you gave in charge
  Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
  When I to feast expressly am forbid;
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


MMMDCCLVI - "ERENEWDWHILSTL"

  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  Who nothing wants to answer her but cries,
  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
  Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
  So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  Longer than I have time to tell his years!


MMMDCCLVII - "IKEAWILLINGPAT"

  I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  And stand upon my common part with those
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
  Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
  And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
  To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.


MMMDCCLVIII - "IENTIWILLDRINK"

  In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
  Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
  If any power pities wretched tears,
  With other princes that may best be spared,
  I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Distinguish him from others, he did keep
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.


MMMDCCLIX - "POTIONSOFEISEL"

  Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
  Such terrible impression made the dream.
  O, let me view his visage, being dead,
  From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.


MMMDCCLX - "GAINSTMYSTRONG"

  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
  I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
  Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


MMMDCCLXI - "INFECTIONNOBIT"

  I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
  The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,
  It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
  Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
  Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Being create for comfort, to be used
  If he be credulous and trust my tale,
  To link my dear friend to a common stale.


MMMDCCLXII - "TERNESSTHATIWI"

  That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:
  Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:
  And yet of moment to, for it concerns
  Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  When the intent of bearing them is just.
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.


MMMDCCLXIII - "LLBITTERTHINKN"

  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Let us not live in France; let us quit all
  But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
  In this same interlude it doth befall
  They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  To have them fall no more: you some permit
  How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
  I spake with the old woman about it.
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?


MMMDCCLXIV - "ORDOUBLEPENANC"

  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Deservedly confined into this rock,
  Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
  And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.


MMMDCCLXV - "ETOCORRECTCORR"

  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  That mought not be distinguished; but at last
  O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
  O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
  To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
  Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
  Out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


MMMDCCLXVI - "ECTIONPITYMETH"

  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
  O, they love least that let men know their love.
  Never came poison from so sweet a place.
  Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,
  It could not else be, I should prove so base,
  That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
  Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
  My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
  He be as miserably slain as I.


MMMDCCLXVII - "ENDEARFRIENDAN"

  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  If low, an agate very vilely cut;
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
  Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
  And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.


MMMDCCLXVIII - "DIASSUREYEEVEN"

  Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
  Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!


MMMDCCLXIX - "THATYOURPITYIS"

  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
  And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
  The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Particularities and petty sounds
  If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  Your legs did better service than your hands.
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.


MMMDCCLXX - "ENOUGHTOCUREME"

  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Nor ask advice of any other thought
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  These eyes that never did nor never shall
  O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  Usurps the regal title and the seat
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Many a morning hath he there been seen,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMDCCLXXI - "YOURLOVEANDPIT"

  Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
  O heavy times, begetting such events!
  Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  And question this most bloody piece of work,
  Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.


MMMDCCLXXII - "YDOTHTHEIMPRES"

  Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
  Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
  The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
  May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.


MMMDCCLXXIII - "SIONFILLWHICHV"

  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
  It seems then that the tidings of this broil
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
  Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
  In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
  He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  He holds your temper in a high respect
  Very hardly upon such a subject.


MMMDCCLXXIV - "ULGARSCANDALST"

  Unto the body of a dismal yew,
  Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
  God grant we never may have need of you!
  A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
  Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
  A kinder value of the people than
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
  Love? his affections do not that way tend;
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.


MMMDCCLXXV - "AMPDUPONMYBROW"

  A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
  Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
  Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
  Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
  Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?


MMMDCCLXXVI - "FORWHATCAREIWH"

  From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  We may not think the justness of each act
  Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
  Am, for his love and service, so to him.
  There lie, and there thy character: there these;
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  Whose memory is written on the earth
  Had not a show might countervail his worth.


MMMDCCLXXVII - "OCALLSMEWELLOR"

  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  And not of any challenge of desert,
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
  Make not too rash a trial of him, for
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.


MMMDCCLXXVIII - "ILLSOYOUOERGRE"

  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
  Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
  Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  Of English Henry, shall this night appear
  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
  O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.


MMMDCCLXXIX - "ENMYBADMYGOODA"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Nay, after that, consume away in rust
  My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
  As, not to see a woman in that term,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
  Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
  An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.


MMMDCCLXXX - "LLOWYOUAREMYAL"

  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
  You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
  O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  And for alliance sake, declare the cause
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  And stay here in your court for three years' space.
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.


MMMDCCLXXXI - "LTHEWORLDANDIM"

  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  The better act of purposes mistook
  Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
  Or not remember what I must be now!
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  My favour were as great; be witness this.


MMMDCCLXXXII - "USTSTRIVETOKNO"

  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
  Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
  The unreasonable fury of a beast:
  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
  I am the greatest, able to do least,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,
  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MMMDCCLXXXIII - "WMYSHAMESANDPR"

  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  You that will follow me to this attempt,
  Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  She is as forward of her breeding as
  Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


MMMDCCLXXXIV - "AISESFROMYOURT"

  Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
  I hope I have your good will, father Page.
  She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
  France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
  My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
  Yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
  Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
  Resolve me with all modest haste which way
  Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.


MMMDCCLXXXV - "ONGUENONEELSET"

  O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
  Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
  Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
  Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Not all these lords do vex me half so much
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  That I may slumber in eternal sleep!


MMMDCCLXXXVI - "OMENORITONONEA"

  O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
  Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
  Out of the path which shall directly lead
  Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
  O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Add an immortal title to your crown!


MMMDCCLXXXVII - "LIVETHATMYSTEE"

  Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
  If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
  Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
  Men do their broken weapons rather use
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMDCCLXXXVIII - "LDSENSEORCHANG"

  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
  Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
  Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
  A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.


MMMDCCLXXXIX - "ESRIGHTORWRONG"

  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  In at his window; set this up with wax
  Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
  Hearing applause and universal shout,
  To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.


MMMDCCXC - "INSOPROFOUNDAB"

  It is the bloody business which informs
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
  Punish my life for tainting of my love!
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
  Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  No more can I be sever'd from your side,
  Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  But prosper better than the Trojan did.


MMMDCCXCI - "YSMITHROWALLCA"

  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
  My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
  If with the sap of reason you would quench,
  That writes them all alike: and so of men.
  His mother was a witch, and one so strong
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
  Wherein we step after a stranger march
  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
  Am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.


MMMDCCXCII - "REOFOTHERSVOIC"

  Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
  Even for this let us divided live,
  O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
  Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
  O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
  To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
  His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
  Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.


MMMDCCXCIII - "ESTHATMYADDERS"

  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Should presently extirpate me and mine
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
  And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
  There is no vice so simple but assumes
  Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
  You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
  And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
  Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.


MMMDCCXCIV - "SENSETOCRITICA"

  Some entertainment for them in their tents.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
  Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
  Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Into a cloven pine; within which rift
  The regent hath with Talbot broke his word
  I have a mind presages me such thrift,
  Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
  Above the reach or compass of thy thought?


MMMDCCXCV - "NDTOFLATTERERS"

  No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Therefore it behoves men to be wary.
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Although I know my years be past the best,
  To carry that which I would have refused,
  The subject will deserve it. Such as give
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.


MMMDCCXCVI - "TOPPEDAREMARKH"

  To use as you think needful of the man.
  On such a full sea are we now afloat;
  Plant those that have revolted in the van,
  Pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.


MMMDCCXCVII - "OWWITHMYNEGLEC"

  One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
  When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
  What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
  I hope I shall know your honour better.
  Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot
  Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
  Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
  Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
  Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
  Lest we remember still that we have none.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Coming and going with thy honey breath.


MMMDCCXCVIII - "TIDODISPENSEYO"

  That which I owe is lost; but if you please
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  You have me, rich; and I will never fail
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.


MMMDCCXCIX - "UARESOSTRONGLY"

  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
  Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  O, that once more you knew but what you are!
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  You know there wants no junkets at the feast.


MMMDCCC - "INMYPURPOSEBRE"

  I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
  Many and hearty thankings to you both.
  You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
  Upon the head of this forgetful man
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Plant those that have revolted in the van,
  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Being so great, I have no need to beg.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMDCCCI - "DTHATALLTHEWOR"

  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  After your highness had reproved the duke
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
  Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?


MMMDCCCII - "LDBESIDESMETHI"

  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
  Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
  By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
  In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
  Have one man but a man? And that is it
  It is extempore, from my mother wit.


MMMDCCCIII - "NKSAREDEADSINC"

  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
  I would not spare my brother in this case,
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
  Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?


MMMDCCCIV - "EILEFTYOUMINEE"

  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  I was not much afeard; for once or twice
  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
  That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
  Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
  Or, if she be accused in true report,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
  Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMDCCCV - "YEISINMYMINDAN"

  Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
  Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
  Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
  My lord, I have consider'd with myself
  I think we are too bold upon your rest:
  Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
  Doth half that glory to the sober west,
  And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
  No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.


MMMDCCCVI - "DTHATWHICHGOVE"

  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  After so long grief, such festivity!
  To take the one the other, by some chance,
  Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
  His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
  In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
  Can justly praise but what he does affect:
  He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
  Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
  O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMDCCCVII - "RNSMETOGOABOUT"

  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
  Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.
  Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
  But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Than was his will to get me, as I think.


MMMDCCCVIII - "DOTHPARTHISFUN"

  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
  There is no composition in these news
  Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  Proud can I never be of what I hate;
  Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
  Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
  It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
  Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
  Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.


MMMDCCCIX - "CTIONANDISPART"

  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
  Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,
  I am a soldier and now bound to France.
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  Now where is he that will not stay so long
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Sent to find those persons whose names are here
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
  To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.


MMMDCCCX - "LYBLINDSEEMSSE"

  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
  But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
  Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MMMDCCCXI - "EINGBUTEFFECTU"

  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  If that his Majesty would aught with us,
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
  Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
  Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
  Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
  Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
  Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
  To mar the subject that before was well?
  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.


MMMDCCCXII - "ALLYISOUTFORIT"

  Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
  Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
  Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,
  If he could burn us all into one coal,
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  O, step between her and her fighting soul
  Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
  The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
  Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
  To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.


MMMDCCCXIII - "NOFORMDELIVERS"

  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
  For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
  Order gave each thing view; the office did
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!


MMMDCCCXIV - "TOTHEHEARTOFBI"

  Their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  And hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
  It is not lost; but what an if it were?


MMMDCCCXV - "RDOFFLOWERORSH"

  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Do to this body what extremes you can;
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
  For, in my conscience, I was the first man
  Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
  On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
  With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.


MMMDCCCXVI - "APEWHICHITDOTH"

  A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
  Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
  Have broken with the king; who hath so far
  I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
  Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  They buy thy help; but Sin ne'er gives a fee,
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me
  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.


MMMDCCCXVII - "LATCHOFHISQUIC"

  Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
  And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
  The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
  Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
  Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
  Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
  From this my hand, as holding of the pope
  His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
  Insinuation, parley and base truce
  Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
  Quit all offences with as clear excuse
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
  Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.


MMMDCCCXVIII - "KOBJECTSHATHTH"

  Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
  Out of the path which shall directly lead
  But had he such a chain of thee or no?
  Justified in our loves; for indeed--
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
  Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
  Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
  Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
  And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
  To banish your defenders; till at length
  He saves my labour by his own approach.
  These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
  Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?


MMMDCCCXIX - "EMINDNOPARTNOR"

  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  I came before you here a man prepared
  Neglect the visitation of my friends.
  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
  O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
  Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
  And if the boy have not a woman's gift
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMMDCCCXX - "HISOWNVISIONHO"

  Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,
  It will determine one way: fare you well.
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
  Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
  No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  It will outrun you, father, in the end.
  Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
  If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
  O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
  Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?
  Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.


MMMDCCCXXI - "LDSWHATITDOTHC"

  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
  He likewise gives a frock or livery,
  And fly would Talbot never, though he might.
  That he would labour my delivery.
  I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
  That wear this world out to the ending doom.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;
  How say you now? is not your husband mad?
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!


MMMDCCCXXII - "ATCHFORIFITSEE"

  As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
  To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  How foul it is; what rank diseases grow,
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  If in which time expired, he not return,
  For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
  If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
  To make me hunger more; that I should forge
  So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMDCCCXXIII - "THERUDESTORGEN"

  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  The argument all bare is of more worth
  Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Great king, within this coffin I present
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?


MMMDCCCXXIV - "TLESTSIGHTTHEM"

  That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
  Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
  Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
  Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
  The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
  The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
  Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!


MMMDCCCXXV - "OSTSWEETFAVOUR"

  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  See how this river comes me cranking in,
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
  Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  The very tyranny and rage of his.
  For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
  As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


MMMDCCCXXVI - "ORDEFORMEDSTCR"

  Only, good master, while we do admire
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Did broach this business to your highness; or
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
  Cold death aside, and with the other sends
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MMMDCCCXXVII - "EATURETHEMOUNT"

  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
  Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!


MMMDCCCXXVIII - "AINORTHESEATHE"

  As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
  In human action and capacity,
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  The king is full of grace and fair regard.
  His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
  Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
  Have studied physic, through which secret art,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMDCCCXXIX - "DAYORNIGHTTHEC"

  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
  If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
  How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
  The letter was not nice but full of charge
  The dark and vicious place where thee he got
  He calls me to a restitution large
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?


MMMDCCCXXX - "ROWORDOVEITSHA"

  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Of woman in me: now from head to foot
  Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
  Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  I cannot be much lower than my knees.
  To him again: tell him he wears the rose
  Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
  Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
  And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?


MMMDCCCXXXI - "PESTHEMTOYOURF"

  Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
  There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
  Hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
  The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
  O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.


MMMDCCCXXXII - "EATUREINCAPABL"

  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  All the charactery of my sad brows:
  Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  Come all to help him, and so stop the air
  And vice sometimes by action dignified.
  Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
  And so I was; which plainly signified
  Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
  Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.


MMMDCCCXXXIII - "EOFMOREREPLETE"

  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
  Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Richly in two short hours. Only they
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  To make that only true we now intend,
  Either of you to be the other's end.


MMMDCCCXXXIV - "WITHYOUMYMOSTT"

  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
  I do not know that Englishman alive
  Talkers are no good doers: be assured
  How many years a mortal man may live.
  You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
  O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
  Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  My life stands in the level of your dreams,
  Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
  There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!


MMMDCCCXXXV - "RUEMINDTHUSMAK"

  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
  He is my prize; I will not look upon.
  Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
  So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
  My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
  A dire induction am I witness to,
  Know I these men that come along with you?


MMMDCCCXXXVI - "ESMINEEYEUNTRU"

  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  My duty to you both, on equal love,
  If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.


MMMDCCCXXXVII - "EORWHETHERDOTH"

  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
  Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Did I put Henry from his native right?
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
  Have I not in my time heard lions roar?


MMMDCCCXXXVIII - "MYMINDBEINGCRO"

  Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
  You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  My father watches. O sir, fly this place!
  I shall not find myself so apt to die:
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
  But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  I would have left it on the board so soon
  Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
  Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  O, this will make my mother die with grief!


MMMDCCCXXXIX - "WNDWITHYOUDRIN"

  When my dimensions are as well compact,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Doing the execution and the act
  What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
  Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
  The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
  Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
  Upon his bad life to make all this good,
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.


MMMDCCCXL - "KUPTHEMONARCHS"

  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  My native English, now I must forego:
  O, none, unless this miracle have might,
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!


MMMDCCCXLI - "PLAGUETHISFLAT"

  Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
  Let not the jealous Day behold that face
  And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
  Good time of day unto your royal grace!
  Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
  Hostility and civil tumult reigns
  I would the state of time had first been whole
  Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
  For you must know, we have with special soul
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
  To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.


MMMDCCCXLII - "TERYORWHETHERS"

  Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
  How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.


MMMDCCCXLIII - "HALLISAYMINEEY"

  Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
  And so by many winding nooks he strays
  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
  Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
  In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
  Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
  Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
  Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
  Must be provided for: and you shall put
  If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
  Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.


MMMDCCCXLIV - "ESAITHTRUEANDT"

  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
  Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
  I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
  The ladder made of cords, and all the means
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
  Do it in hope of fair advantages:
  To match with her that brings no vantages.


MMMDCCCXLV - "HATYOURLOVETAU"

  Him: discuss the same in French unto him.
  After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  You have forgot the will I told you of.
  Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  The manner of their taking may appear
  And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?


MMMDCCCXLVI - "GHTITTHISALCHE"

  Go with me; if you like upon report
  Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
  To spoil the city and your royal court.
  It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
  To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
  That what he will he does, and does so much
  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  I give to both your speeches, which were such
  Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
  And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
  Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
  Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
  He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMDCCCXLVII - "MYTOMAKEOFMONS"

  My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
  Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
  O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
  Men do their broken weapons rather use
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.


MMMDCCCXLVIII - "TERSANDTHINGSI"

  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:
  A thievish living on the common road?
  Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  I could marry this wench for this device.


MMMDCCCXLIX - "NDIGESTSUCHCHE"

  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
  Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
  I do not greatly care to be deceived,
  Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
  So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Can any way speak in his just commend;
  High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMDCCCL - "RUBINSASYOURSW"

  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O
  But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  I read it in the grammar long ago.
  Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
  So in the earth, to this day is not known:
  As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
  Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
  Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
  Why did you bring these daggers from the place?


MMMDCCCLI - "EETSELFRESEMBL"

  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
  Send for the county; go tell him of this:
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.


MMMDCCCLII - "ECREATINGEVERY"

  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Can any way speak in his just commend;
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  And fawn on rage with base humility,
  To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
  Into her womb convey sterility;
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?


MMMDCCCLIII - "BADAPERFECTBES"

  Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
  And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  And lookest to command the prince and realm.
  Pity was all the fault that was in me;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
  Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
  To tread a measure with you on this grass.
  But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.


MMMDCCCLIV - "TASFASTASOBJEC"

  That in the ocean seeks another drop,
  And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!
  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  For the intent and purpose of the law
  A' was a merry man--took up the child:
  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
  And your great love to me restrains you thus:
  Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
  Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
  But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
  Join with me to forbid him her resort;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.


MMMDCCCLV - "TSTOHISBEAMSAS"

  This shall be done, good father, presently.
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Out of my lean and low ability
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  I would have had thee there, and here again,
  She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
  But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  And for his ordinary pays his heart
  My chaplain to no creature living, but
  So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
  And wear it in my heart. Why, then, be sad;
  Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.


MMMDCCCLVI - "SEMBLEOTISTHEF"

  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
  Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
  So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,
  To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
  Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.


MMMDCCCLVII - "IRSTTISFLATTER"

  I say she shall. And first begin with her.
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
  To trust the opportunity of night
  That the old carlot once was master of.
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
  From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  A begging prince what beggar pities not?
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMMDCCCLVIII - "YINMYSEEINGAND"

  Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
  I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
  You make strong party, or defend yourself
  So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Going to chapel; and the voice is now
  And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
  Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?


MMMDCCCLIX - "MYGREATMINDMOS"

  More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
  You never spoke what did become you less
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  And with his mad attendant and himself,
  Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
  My frail mortality to know itself,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
  Or but a sickly part of one true sense
  Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!


MMMDCCCLX - "TKINGLYDRINKSI"

  Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  It shows my earnestness of affection-
  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
  Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
  Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
  Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?


MMMDCCCLXI - "TUPMINEEYEWELL"

  That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  Methinks already in this civil broil
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Nimbly she fastens:--O, how quick is love!--
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  You do it for increase: O strange excuse,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Who in this dull and long-continued truce
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
  Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.


MMMDCCCLXII - "KNOWSWHATWITHH"

  Kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
  We may of their encounter frankly judge
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  With courtesy and with respect enough;
  How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
  And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Then 'tis but reason that I be released
  Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
  He is no less than what we say he is.


MMMDCCCLXIII - "ISGUSTISGREEIN"

  In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
  Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
  Give me some music; music, moody food
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  The life, the right and truth of all this realm
  If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
  No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.


MMMDCCCLXIV - "GANDTOHISPALAT"

  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  During the time Edward the Third did reign.
  Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
  Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
  His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  Into one giant arm, it shall not force
  She is as forward of her breeding as
  Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
  A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
  And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
  Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?


MMMDCCCLXV - "EDOTHPREPARETH"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
  His phoenix down began but to appear
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
  He is not with himself; let us withdraw.


MMMDCCCLXVI - "ECUPIFITBEPOIS"

  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Philip of France, in right and true behalf
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
  For ever and for ever shall be yours.
  I have with such provision in mine art
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
  I have inform'd his highness so at large
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.


MMMDCCCLXVII - "ONDTISTHELESSE"

  Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
  No messenger, but thine; and all alone
  Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
  Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  If any ship put out, then straight away.
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  This night forestall him of the coming day!
  Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
  Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMDCCCLXVIII - "RSINTHATMINEEY"

  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
  His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  To nature none more bound; his training such,
  My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.


MMMDCCCLXIX - "ELOVESITANDDOT"

  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  She will be sick else. This day, no man think
  I have no will to wander forth of doors,
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
  Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!
  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
  They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.


MMMDCCCLXX - "HFIRSTBEGINTHO"

  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
  Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
  It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
  Between these woolly breeders in the act,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Gather the sequel by that went before.
  If at Philippi we do face him there,
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.


MMMDCCCLXXI - "SELINESTHATIBE"

  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Lady, you know no rules of charity,
  It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
  Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
  Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:
  A milk-sop, one that never in his life
  That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
  It tutors nature: artificial strife
  By bud of nobler race: this is an art
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMDCCCLXXII - "FOREHAVEWRITDO"

  Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
  And thou art wedded to calamity.
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  I have a heart as little apt as yours,
  Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
  Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
  O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?


MMMDCCCLXXIII - "LIEEVENTHOSETH"

  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
  That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
  He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
  Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
  How does your lady? and how thrives your love?


MMMDCCCLXXIV - "ATSAIDICOULDNO"

  Amazedly in her sad face he stares:
  The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
  Scorn and derision never come in tears:
  Are made already mothers: by my count,
  In him that should compare. I do not think
  Do I put up that womanly defence,
  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  Of my consent that she should be your wife.
  Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
  Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.


MMMDCCCLXXV - "TLOVEYOUDEARER"

  That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  You are transported by calamity
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Us friends; I will pursue the amity.
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.


MMMDCCCLXXVI - "YETTHENMYJUDGM"

  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
  The resignation of thy state and crown
  Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Divide your happy England into four;
  Good King, that must approve the common saw,
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.


MMMDCCCLXXVII - "ENTKNEWNOREASO"

  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  None wed the second but who killed the first.
  O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
  See better, Lear, and let me still remain
  O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!


MMMDCCCLXXVIII - "NWHYMYMOSTFULL"

  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
  Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
  He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
  You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
  You tread upon my patience: but be sure
  Methinks I should not thus be led along,
  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
  Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
  For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
  Unless he take the course that you have done,
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Look that you take upon you as you should.


MMMDCCCLXXIX - "FLAMESHOULDAFT"

  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
  A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
  My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  She marking them begins a wailing note
  He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
  Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask
  For beauty starved with her severity
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.


MMMDCCCLXXX - "ERWARDSBURNCLE"

  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  When second husband let me be accurst!
  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
  So is it in the music of men's lives.
  But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or
  Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMMDCCCLXXXI - "ARERBUTRECKONI"

  A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  But rather one that smiles and still invites
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  The grosser manner of these world's delights
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Of dear import, and the neglecting it
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
  In courtesy gives undeserving praise.


MMMDCCCLXXXII - "NGTIMEWHOSEMIL"

  No better than the earth he lies upon,
  Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
  To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
  In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
  My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
  Here are your sons again; and I must lose
  O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
  Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.


MMMDCCCLXXXIII - "LIONDACCIDENTS"

  Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  On pain of death, no person be so bold
  Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
  Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
  Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
  Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.


MMMDCCCLXXXIV - "CREEPINTWIXTVO"

  Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
  I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  We'll execute your purpose, and put on
  In disadvantage, to abide a field
 eXcels whatever yet you look'd upon
  That cannot so much as a blossom yield
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.


MMMDCCCLXXXV - "WSANDCHANGEDEC"

  Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  Cause the musicians play me that sad note
  His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
  And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.


MMMDCCCLXXXVI - "REESOFKINGSTAN"

  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
  Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
  Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
  A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.


MMMDCCCLXXXVII - "SACREDBEAUTYBL"

  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
  And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
  Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
  Because we ever have been near the king.
  Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.


MMMDCCCLXXXVIII - "UNTTHESHARPSTI"

  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
  Thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
  To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  I will not rise, unless your highness grant.


MMMDCCCLXXXIX - "NTENTSDIVERTST"

  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  The very mercy of the law cries out
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
  Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.


MMMDCCCXC - "RONGMINDSTOTHE"

  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
  Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
  I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
  Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  Strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMDCCCXCI - "COURSEOFALTERI"

  Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
  Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
  And from this swarm of fair advantages
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  To match with her that brings no vantages.
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  It is not, nor it cannot come to good.


MMMDCCCXCII - "NGTHINGSALASWH"

  Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  To die is to be banish'd from myself;
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
  Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!


MMMDCCCXCIII - "YFEARINGOFTIME"

  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
  From son to son, some four or five descents
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  I could have well diverted her intents,
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMMDCCCXCIV - "STYRANNYMIGHTI"

  Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
  To wring the widow from her custom'd right,
  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
  No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
  Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
  Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
  To gratify your honourable youth,
  In saying so, you shall but say the truth.


MMMDCCCXCV - "NOTTHENSAYNOWI"

  No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
  Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
  That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
  Tell me wherein have I offended most?
  How innocent she died; and if your love
  Even for this let us divided live,
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
  Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
  Not by might master'd but by special grace:
  Of that we have: so then we do neglect
  Wherein my sword had not impressure made
  I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!


MMMDCCCXCVI - "LOVEYOUBESTWHE"

  Love loving not itself none other can.
  O, lest the world should task you to recite
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  But now I see this one is one too much,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
  When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!
  How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MMMDCCCXCVII - "NIWASCERTAINOE"

  Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
  As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
  So shall those blots that do with me remain
  Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
  Are of imagination all compact:
  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMDCCCXCVIII - "RINCERTAINTYCR"

  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  To be a secondary at control,
  And when I told the empress of this sport,
  I am resolved to bear a greater storm
  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
  Together with that fair and warlike form
  You give away myself, which is known mine;
  Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMDCCCXCIX - "OWNINGTHEPRESE"

  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
  When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
  Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
  In war was never lion raged more fierce,
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  The guilty rebel for remission prays.
  His going I could frame to serve my turn,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Princes in this should live like gods above,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMCM - "NTDOUBTINGOFTH"

  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
  That takes away by any secret course
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
  Upon the parting of your wives and you.
  But little stars may hide them when they list.
  The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
  If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
  Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
  Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
  For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
  That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
  Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?


MMMCMI - "ERESTLOVEISABA"

  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Of marching to Philippi presently?
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Even for this let us divided live,
  It does abhor me now I speak the word;
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
  But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
  And he the burden of a guilty mind.


MMMCMII - "BETHENMIGHTINO"

  By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  There is no malice in this burning coal;
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
  In quantity equals not one of yours:
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
  Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.


MMMCMIII - "TSAYSOTOGIVEFU"

  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
  And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
  Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  I send them back again and straight grow sad.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
  Upon so soft a subject as myself!


MMMCMIV - "LLGROWTHTOTHAT"

  Lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
  How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,
  And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
  That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!


MMMCMV - "WHICHSTILLDOTH"

  Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
  Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
  Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
  See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
  Than history can pattern, though devised
  I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
  Did he so often lodge in open field,
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Though it be honest, it is never good
  He lives that loves thee better than he could.


MMMCMVI - "GROWLETMENOTTO"

  Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  Or whether 'twas report of her success;
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
  My love admits no qualifying dross;
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
  That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
  Their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!


MMMCMVII - "THEMARRIAGEOFT"

  Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
  Her more than haste is mated with delays,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,
  And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
  I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
  And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
  Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
  True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.


MMMCMVIII - "RUEMINDSADMITI"

  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
  Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
  No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
  Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
  Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
  The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
  In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?


MMMCMIX - "MPEDIMENTSLOVE"

  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  Possess them not with fear; take from them now
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
  I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
  Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Order gave each thing view; the office did
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMCMX - "ISNOTLOVEWHICH"

  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Nor no one here; for curses never pass
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Will I with wine and wassail so convince
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  I heard no letter from my master since
  Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


MMMCMXI - "ALTERSWHENITAL"

  All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
  Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
  Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  No news so bad abroad as this at home;
  Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
  Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
  And threat me I shall never come to bliss
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?


MMMCMXII - "TERATIONFINDSO"

  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
  Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  From this time forth I never will speak word.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.


MMMCMXIII - "RBENDSWITHTHER"

  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
  Such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
  Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
  I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
  Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
  How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


MMMCMXIV - "EMOVERTOREMOVE"

  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
  Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMCMXV - "ONOITISANEVERF"

  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
  That's mercy, but too much security:
  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Shall give a holiness, a purity,
  And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  From whence you spring by lineal descent.


MMMCMXVI - "IXEDMARKTHATLO"

  I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
 eXceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Disgracing of these colours that I wear
  Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,
  And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Knight of the noble order of Saint George,
  The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
  Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
  All preparation for a bloody siege
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
  Or else what lets it but he would be here?


MMMCMXVII - "OKSONTEMPESTSA"

  O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
  The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  And climb the highest promontory top.


MMMCMXVIII - "NDISNEVERSHAKE"

  No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
  She takes a sword and runs at him behind.
  Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Robs me of that which not enriches him
  Should not become my wife and England's queen.
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
  Knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MMMCMXIX - "NITISTHESTARTO"

  None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
  Invited her to supper: she replied,
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;
  She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;
  The enemy more mighty than he seems:
  How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
  Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!


MMMCMXX - "EVERYWANDERING"

  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
  Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
  Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
  Nor can one England brook a double reign,
  Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Give so much light that I may read by them.


MMMCMXXI - "BARKWHOSEWORTH"

  Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
  A' was a merry man--took up the child:
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
  Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
  Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
  He couples it to his complaining names.


MMMCMXXII - "SUNKNOWNALTHOU"

  Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Not all these lords do vex me half so much
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  And dispossessing all my other parts
  Let me be blest to make this happy close;
  To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!


MMMCMXXIII - "GHHISHEIGHTBET"

  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
  Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;
  Insulting tyranny begins to jet
  Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
  Give me some music; music, moody food
  He's a disease that must be cut away.
  There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
  But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.


MMMCMXXIV - "AKENLOVESNOTTI"

  As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
  Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
  Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Or in the night, imagining some fear,
  To carry that which I would have refused,
  The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
  I hope I have your good will, father Page.


MMMCMXXV - "MESFOOLTHOUGHR"

  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
  For so your doctors hold it very meet,
  Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
  Let me be blest to make this happy close;
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.


MMMCMXXVI - "OSYLIPSANDCHEE"

  Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
  Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
  Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
  Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
  I prithee, name the time, but let it not
  Persuaded him from any further act:
  She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
  Are of imagination all compact:
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMCMXXVII - "KSWITHINHISBEN"

  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
  With your stiff age: but unto us it is
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  To be discover'd, that can do me good?
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  It doth forget to do the thing it should,
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  He is complete in feature and in mind
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  She takes a sword and runs at him behind.
  Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Not to the beast that would usurp their den.


MMMCMXXVIII - "DINGSICKLESCOM"

  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
  Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
  Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.


MMMCMXXIX - "PASSCOMELOVEAL"

  Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
  Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
  Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
  Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  Must not be measured by his worth, for then
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And for your rapier most especially,
  Labour and effect one thing specially.


MMMCMXXX - "TERSNOTWITHHIS"

  The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Rest on my word, and let not discontent
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
  Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
  In weeping after this untimely bier.
  To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
  Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  She shall undo her credit with the Moor.


MMMCMXXXI - "BRIEFHOURSANDW"

  Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
  Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
  What likelihood of his amendment, lords?


MMMCMXXXII - "EEKSBUTBEARSIT"

  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Say they are not the men you took them for.
  But I should think of shallows and of flats,
  Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
  Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
  Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?


MMMCMXXXIII - "OUTEVENTOTHEED"

  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  That fears his fellowship to die with us.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
  Hate counsels not in such a quality.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?


MMMCMXXXIV - "GEOFDOOMIFTHIS"

  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
  Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
  If sorrow can admit society,
  Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  He hath not told us of the captain yet:
  If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.


MMMCMXXXV - "BEERRORANDUPON"

  Being the bosom lover of my lord,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
  Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
  Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
  And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
  Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
  Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


MMMCMXXXVI - "MEPROVEDINEVER"

  My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  If you think fit, or that it may be done,
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MMMCMXXXVII - "WRITNORNOMANEV"

  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  I tender so the safety of my liege.
  Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
  Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  Are hated most of those they did deceive,
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMCMXXXVIII - "ERLOVEDACCUSEM"

  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
  Consent, and for thy honour give consent,
  Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?


MMMCMXXXIX - "ETHUSTHATIHAVE"

  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
  Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
  Such terrible impression made the dream.
  Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
  That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
  I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.


MMMCMXL - "SCANTEDALLWHER"

  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  And I had many living to upbraid
  Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
  Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMMCMXLI - "EINISHOULDYOUR"

  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
  Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


MMMCMXLII - "GREATDESERTSRE"

  Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
  Retaining but a quantity of life,
  Except you mean with obstinate repulse
  A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
  That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
  Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
  So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.


MMMCMXLIII - "PAYFORGOTUPONY"

  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
  You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
  For God forbid so many simple souls
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  To find his title with some shows of truth,
  Unable to support this lump of clay,
  Partly that I have need of such a youth
  Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  You were as good to shoot against the wind.


MMMCMXLIV - "OURDEARESTLOVE"

  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  To reason most absurd, whose common theme
  Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMCMXLV - "TOCALLWHERETOA"

  Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
  Or worthily, as a good subject should,
  Come all to help him, and so stop the air
  As all things shall redound unto your good.
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  Let liberty make use of; space enough
  Was carried with more speed before the wind;
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  The hum of either army stilly sounds,
  Of one or both of us the time is come.
  A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.


MMMCMXLVI - "LLBONDSDOTIEME"

  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Deliver up my title in the queen
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
  That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
  Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMCMXLVII - "DAYBYDAYTHATIH"

  Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
  And feed his humour kindly as we may,
  You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
  But shall we wear these honours for a day?
  Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
  Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
  Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
  The better that your lordship please to ask.
  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask
  Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
  I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.


MMMCMXLVIII - "AVEFREQUENTBEE"

  As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
  Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Now will we take some order in the town,
  That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
  By wounding his belief in her renown
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMCMXLIX - "NWITHUNKNOWNMI"

  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades
  Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
  O, no! the apprehension of the good
  When love, converted from the thing it was,
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
  I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.


MMMCML - "NDSANDGIVENTOT"

  Necessity will make us all forsworn
  Delighted them in any other form;
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  And what God will, that let your king perform;
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  The old bees die, the young possess their hive:
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  To charge me to an answer, as the pope.


MMMCMLI - "IMEYOUROWNDEAR"

  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
  Making, to take your imagination,
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  You were of our determination!
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Upon the next occasion that we meet,
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  With letters of commission from the king.
  Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.


MMMCMLII - "PURCHASEDRIGHT"

  Proclamation, and he rails upon me.
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
  Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
  How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad!
  A man of complements, whom right and wrong
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
  Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.


MMMCMLIII - "THATIHAVEHOIST"

  Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
  How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
  And on the pieces of the broken wand
  To his confine; and of the truth herein
  I dreamt my master and another fought,
  Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
  And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  So do the kings of France unto this day;
  That thou consent to marry us to-day.


MMMCMLIV - "EDSAILTOALLTHE"

  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Distract your army, which doth most consist
  So two, together weeping, make one woe.
  And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
  I speak of Africa and golden joys.
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  That all the court may echo with the noise.
  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
  And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  He came in thunder; his celestial breath
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMCMLV - "WINDSWHICHSHOU"

  When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
  Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
  How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
  He well may be a stranger, for he comes
  Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.


MMMCMLVI - "LDTRANSPORTMEF"

  Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
  Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
  This body, like to them, to what I must;
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:
  Pinched with the colic, you make faces like
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.


MMMCMLVII - "ARTHESTFROMYOU"

  As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
  Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
  Therefore this article is made in vain,
  Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.


MMMCMLVIII - "RSIGHTBOOKBOTH"

  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
  If any born at Ephesus be seen
  Good friends for three reprieves for you and your
  Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  But that my noble master will appear
  Of our restored love and amity.
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
  Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?
  That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.


MMMCMLIX - "MYWILFULNESSAN"

  My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,
  You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
  Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
  Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.


MMMCMLX - "DERRORSDOWNAND"

  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!


MMMCMLXI - "ONJUSTPROOFSUR"

  Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Justice with favour have I always done;
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,
  This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.


MMMCMLXII - "MISEACCUMULATE"

  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
  If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
  Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
  Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
  Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.


MMMCMLXIII - "BRINGMEWITHINT"

  Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
  My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  With this, she falleth in the place she stood,
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  To strive for that which resteth in my choice.


MMMCMLXIV - "HELEVELOFYOURF"

  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
  For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
  Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
  O sir, you are not right: have you not known
  Upon so soft a subject as myself!
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  For we were subjects but while you were king.


MMMCMLXV - "ROWNBUTSHOOTNO"

  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
  Some entertainment for them in their tents.
  Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  Nor thrust your head into the public street
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


MMMCMLXVI - "TATMEINYOURWAK"

  That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
  And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
  The interruption of their churlish drums
  Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
  Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
  Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  With all religious strength of sacred vows;
  And some donation freely to estate
  Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.


MMMCMLXVII - "ENDHATESINCEMY"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  At thy affections, which do hold a wing
  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  So long in his unlucky Irish wars
  Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Make you to ravel all this matter out,
  You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.


MMMCMLXVIII - "APPEALSAYSIDID"

  As touching France, to give a greater sum
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  As much as in him lies, from time to time
  Late did he shine upon the English side;
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried,
  You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  Did lately meet in the intestine shock
  I'll buckler thee against a million.
  Desire them an to my pavilion.


MMMCMLXIX - "STRIVETOPROVET"

  Shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  That holy duty, out of dear respect,
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  To link my dear friend to a common stale.


MMMCMLXX - "HECONSTANCYAND"

  He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Came to my house and took away my ring--
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Not all these lords do vex me half so much
  So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
  Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
  Your master will be dead ere you return;
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.


MMMCMLXXI - "VIRTUEOFYOURLO"

  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
  For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
  Or in my cell there would she kill herself.


MMMCMLXXII - "VELIKEASTOMAKE"

  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
  King John, your king and England's doth approach,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
  Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
  To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  My father made in compassing the crown!
  And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.


MMMCMLXXIII - "OURAPPETITESMO"

  Of disobedient opposition
  Unto thy value I will mount myself
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Antony call; I see him rouse himself
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  To Edward, but not to the English king.
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
  My favour were as great; be witness this.
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!


MMMCMLXXIV - "REKEENWITHEAGE"

  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
  What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
  I to myself am dearer than a friend,
  That their negotiations all must slack,
  He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  And, till so much blood thither come again,
  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.


MMMCMLXXV - "RCOMPOUNDSWEOU"

  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Commit the war of white and damask in
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Might there not be a charity in sin
  Posterity, await for wretched years,
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.


MMMCMLXXVI - "RPALATEURGEAST"

  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  And both the princes had been breathing here,
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
  To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  And see the revolution of the times
  Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
  Than I by letters shall direct your course.


MMMCMLXXVII - "OPREVENTOURMAL"

  O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
  Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
  To have a godly peace concluded of
  On yon proud man, should take it off again
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
  As bombast and as lining to the time:
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.


MMMCMLXXVIII - "ADIESUNSEENWES"

  An earnest conjuration from the King,
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Not sure, though hoping of this good success,
  Wherein the toged consuls can propose
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.


MMMCMLXXIX - "ICKENTOSHUNSIC"

  I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
  Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
  Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
  O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
  Sits not so easy on me as you think.
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  Such men as he be never at heart's ease
  In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
  Call for the music in the other room.


MMMCMLXXX - "KNESSWHENWEPUR"

  Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
  Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,
  He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
  What say you to a letter from your friends
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.


MMMCMLXXXI - "GEEVENSOBEINGT"

  Grow great by your example and put on
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
  O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
  But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  I'll send them all as willing as I live:
  Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?


MMMCMLXXXII - "UFFOFYOURNEERC"

  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  For now I stand as one upon a rock
  For these known evils, but to give me leave,
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  False to his children or his wife's allies
  Your native town you enter'd like a post,
  O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.


MMMCMLXXXIII - "LOYINGSWEETNES"

  Let us sway on and face them in the field.
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
  Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
  With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!


MMMCMLXXXIV - "STOBITTERSAUCE"

  Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
  Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:
  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Reserve their character with golden quill
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMCMLXXXV - "SDIDIFRAMEMYFE"

  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
  I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  Doth any name particular belong
  If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
  For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
  Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


MMMCMLXXXVI - "EDINGANDSICKOF"

  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
  If Richard will be true, not that alone
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
  An't please your grace, the two great cardinals
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
  Can play upon it. But what need I thus
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!


MMMCMLXXXVII - "WELFAREFOUNDAK"

  Why should my heart think that a several plot
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
  And what a terror he had been to France.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
  O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
  Upon this promise did he raise his chin,
  Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
  Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
  And not be seen to wink of all the day--
  Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.


MMMCMLXXXVIII - "INDOFMEETNESST"

  I would not my unhoused free condition
  No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
  For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Even for this let us divided live,
  That excellent complexion, which did steal
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.


MMMCMLXXXIX - "OBEDISEASEDERE"

  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
  Save base authority from others' books
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMMCMXC - "THATTHEREWASTR"

  Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
  And leave us to our free election.
  The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
  The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
  Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
  And to proclaim it civilly, were like
  Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
  Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMCMXCI - "UENEEDINGTHUSP"

  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  To do a great right, do a little wrong,
  Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
  Upon my wretched women, that so long
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!


MMMCMXCII - "OLICYINLOVETOA"

  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
  Led hither by pure love: which of them both
  I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
  Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
  You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
  It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  That I, unworthy body as I am,
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Awake, awake, English nobility!


MMMCMXCIII - "NTICIPATETHEIL"

  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
  If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
  Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
  And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
  Leaving thee living in posterity?


MMMCMXCIV - "LSTHATWERENOTG"

  Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  To new remembrance. For full well he knows
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  The life, the right and truth of all this realm
  Wave thus, to express his disposition,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Retain but privilege of a private man?
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.


MMMCMXCV - "REWTOFAULTSASS"

  Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  To leave that latest which concerns him first,
  Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
  Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
  An honest man he is, and hates the slime
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
  The keeper of the prison, call to him;
  Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
  And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:
  Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
  Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.


MMMCMXCVI - "UREDANDBROUGHT"

  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
  Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
  Do with your injuries as seems you best,
  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
  Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
  His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
  That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.


MMMCMXCVII - "TOMEDICINEAHEA"

  To gratify your honourable youth,
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
  Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
  I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  And make her bear the penance of her tongue?


MMMCMXCVIII - "LTHFULSTATEWHI"

  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  How he her chamber-window will ascend
  For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
  Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
  The image of a wicked heinous fault
  And let us do it with no show of fear;
  Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
  His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
  In awe of such a thing as I myself.


MMMCMXCIX - "CHRANKOFGOODNE"

  Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
  Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
  For on his visage was in little drawn
  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
  Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.


MMMM - "SSWOULDBYILLBE"

  Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
  Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
  When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
  Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
  You not your child well loving, yet I find
  I am undone: there is no living, none,
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;
  Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMI - "CUREDBUTTHENCE"

  Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
  Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
  Base inclination and the start of spleen
  Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
  That everything I look on seemeth green;
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Have I not heard these islanders shout out
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Committing me unto my brother's love;
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMMII - "ILEARNANDFINDT"

  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  And of so easy and so plain a stop
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Not so; but it hath been the longest night
  And with submissive loyalty of heart
  Never to be infected with delight,
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
  Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,
  That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.


MMMMIII - "HELESSONTRUEDR"

  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Under a cloak that is of any length.
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MMMMIV - "UGSPOISONHIMTH"

  Upon the very naked name of love.
  Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
  I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
  Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.


MMMMV - "ATSOFELLSICKOF"

  A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
  To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
  Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
  From Rome all season'd office and to wind
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Let his deservings and my love withal
  Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
  Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  For that sweet odour which doth in it live.


MMMMVI - "YOUWHATPOTIONS"

  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Of what degree soever, with his brother.
  Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
  When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
  He shall have merely justice and his bond.
  All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
  Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
  I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  So let us still continue peace and love.


MMMMVII - "HAVEIDRUNKOFSI"

  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  I know him well. He is the broach indeed
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
  In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?


MMMMVIII - "RENTEARSDISTIL"

  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  This widow lady? In her right we came;
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And let it be confiscate all, so soon
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
  Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;
  Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:
  I, then in London keeper of the king,
  Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.


MMMMIX - "LDFROMLIMBECKS"

  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Driving back shadows over louring hills:
  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
  Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
  Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
  In the division of each several crime,
  My mother is assailed in our tent,
  Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
  King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
  Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!


MMMMX - "FOULASHELLWITH"

  Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
  Or any air of music touch their ears,
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
  All's well; and might have been much better, if
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
  Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
  Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
  I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
  That through the length of times he stands disgraced:
  Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.


MMMMXI - "INAPPLYINGFEAR"

  Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
  No more than my residing here at Rome
  And military title capital
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
  Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
  I will your very faithful feeder be,
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
  From first to last, the onset and retire
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.


MMMMXII - "STOHOPESANDHOP"

  Should of another therefore be abused!
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Or in the night, imagining some fear,
  Please it your majesty, this is the man
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  And have no more of life than may suffice
  Nativity, once in the main of light,
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  How shall I know if I do choose the right?
  O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
  Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?


MMMMXIII - "ESTOFEARSSTILL"

  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  That men must lay their murders on your neck.
  Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
  From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
  She either gives a stomach and no food-
  The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
  In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
  Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;
  Look upon him, love him; he worships you.


MMMMXIV - "LOSINGWHENISAW"

  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  I read as much as from the rattling tongue
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
  Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
  Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  No other harm but loss of such a lord.
  It were no match, your nail against his horn.
  So should my shame still rest upon record,
  And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
  When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.


MMMMXV - "MYSELFTOWINWHA"

  My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,
  You go not till I set you up a glass
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
  That you protect this course, and put it on
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
  Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
  We have had pelting wars, since you refused
  Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
  Are yet two Romans living such as these?


MMMMXVI - "TWRETCHEDERROR"

  There is no world without Verona walls,
  What maintenance he from his friends receives,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  That tremble at the imagination?
  Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  O, they did urge it still unto the king!
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


MMMMXVII - "SHATHMYHEARTCO"

  See where they come: we will behold his death.
  How can she be with him? When was she missed?
  And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
  That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
  Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
  Make mountains level, and the continent,
  Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
  He says he will return incontinent:
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
  Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
  Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.


MMMMXVIII - "MMITTEDWHILSTI"

  My lord your son made me to think of this;
  Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
  To this I witness call the fools of time,
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
  I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  Speak England first, that hath been forward first
  Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
  In your behalf still will I wear the same.


MMMMXIX - "THATHTHOUGHTIT"

  Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
  To speak so indirectly I am loath:
  How he did seem to dive into their hearts
  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
  The greatest strength and power he can make,
  It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
  The Nevils are thy subjects to command.


MMMMXX - "SELFSOBLESSEDN"

  So thin that life looks through, and will break out.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  On them to look, and practise by myself.
  Between compulsion and a brave respect!
  Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Sorry I am my noble cousin should
  Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Never yet taint with love, I send the king.


MMMMXXI - "EVERHOWHAVEMIN"

  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  He would show most love. When yet he was but
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Was I a child to fear I know not what.
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.


MMMMXXII - "EEYESOUTOFTHEI"

  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
  Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
  For you have but mistook me all this while:
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
  He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  In your own losses, if he stay in France.


MMMMXXIII - "RSPHERESBEENFI"

  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
  I know not why, except to get the land.


MMMMXXIV - "TTEDINTHEDISTR"

  Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
  Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
  Now go with me and with this holy man
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
  Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.


MMMMXXV - "ACTIONOFTHISMA"

  Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  O, sure I am, the wits of former days
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
  For lovers ever run before the clock.
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;
  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
  And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.


MMMMXXVI - "DDINGFEVEROBEN"

  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Is it so nominated in the bond?
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
  Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MMMMXXVII - "EFITOFILLNOWIF"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
  I dreamt my master and another fought,
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  O night, which ever art when day is not!
  For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
  I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
  Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
  O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
  When you are better temper'd to attend.
  I pray you tell me what you meant by that.
  For men to see, and seeing wonder at.


MMMMXXVIII - "INDTRUETHATBET"

  I rather of his absence make this use:
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  The kiss you take is better than you give;
  Rest on my word, and let not discontent
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
  The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
  Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!


MMMMXXIX - "TERISBYEVILSTI"

  This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
  Send her a story of thy noble acts;
  But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
  You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;
  I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.


MMMMXXX - "LLMADEBETTERAN"

  Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
  Let that one article rank with the rest;
  My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
  A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
  Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
  The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!


MMMMXXXI - "DRUINDLOVEWHEN"

  Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
  Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
  Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
  He does deny him, in respect of his,
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.


MMMMXXXII - "ITISBUILTANEWG"

  I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
  Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
  I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
  But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:
  Although the last, not least; to whose young love
  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
  God knows I will not do it, to the death.


MMMMXXXIII - "ROWSFAIRERTHAN"

  Richer than that which four successive kings
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
  She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
  From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  I do not know that Englishman alive
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Though you are old enough to be my heir.
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
  And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


MMMMXXXIV - "ATFIRSTMORESTR"

  Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
  Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
  Fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
  Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Should dying men flatter with those that live?
  That tide will stay me longer than I should.
  My faith and this the princess I did give:
  On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Send for your ring, I will return it home,
  To show yourself your father's son in deed
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!


MMMMXXXV - "ONGFARGREATERS"

  Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
  No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
  Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
  For yet his honour never heard a play,
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
  To mend the petty present, I will piece
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!


MMMMXXXVI - "OIRETURNREBUKE"

  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
  Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  But if the gods themselves did see her then,
  Unmeritable shuns your high request.
  Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMMXXXVII - "DTOMYCONTENTAN"

  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  Or bring your latter hazard back again
  Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord?
  Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
  To do this outrage: and it now is done.
  All days are nights to see till I see thee,
  Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?


MMMMXXXVIII - "DGAINBYILLTHRI"

  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
  And not alone in habit and device,
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
  Your master will be dead ere you return;
  Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
  Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
  How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  I'd set my ten commandments in your face.


MMMMXXXIX - "CEMORETHANIHAV"

  Can justly praise but what he does affect:
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
  Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
  A foutra for the world and worldlings base!
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMMXL - "ESPENTTHATYOUW"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  She was too good for me: but, as I said,
  Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
  This is not strong enough to be believed
  He calls me to a restitution large
  Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
  Till his breath breatheth life in her again.
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
  Of what she was no semblance did remain:
  Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
  Where is the gentleman that was with her?


MMMMXLI - "EREONCEUNKINDB"

  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Retaining but a quantity of life,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  Nor do I as an enemy to peace
  Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Unable to support this lump of clay,
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
  Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
  Definitively thus I answer you.
  Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?


MMMMXLII - "EFRIENDSMENOWA"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Never so needful on the earth of France,
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
  O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
  Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
  Against the pope and count his friends my foes.


MMMMXLIII - "NDFORTHATSORRO"

  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  That he could nothing do but wish and beg
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?


MMMMXLIV - "WWHICHITHENDID"

  When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
  Whether it be through force of your report,
  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
  I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
  Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  To take the basest and most poorest shape
  Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Never to speak of this that you have heard:
  Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
  I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
  Does not divide the Sunday from the week.


MMMMXLV - "FEELNEEDSMUSTI"

  For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Let him go up into the public chair;
  Never was seen so black a day as this:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
  Such terrible impression made the dream.
  To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
  I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.


MMMMXLVI - "UNDERMYTRANSGR"

  Unless it be to come before their time;
  Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
  Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MMMMXLVII - "ESSIONBOWUNLES"

  Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:
  Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
  So many English kings. Thy due from me
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
  Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!


MMMMXLVIII - "SMYNERVESWEREB"

  So many guests invite as here are writ.
  Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
  Your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.
  No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  So many blows upon this face of mine,
  Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!


MMMMXLIX - "RASSORHAMMERDS"

  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  So mighty and so many my defects,
  O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
  And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
  My judgment is we should not step too far
  Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
  So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.


MMMML - "TEELFORIFYOUWE"

  Ten years are spent since first he undertook
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
  Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMMLI - "REBYMYUNKINDNE"

  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  Master, your love must live a maid at home;
  Yet nature might have made me as these are,
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  I could have better spared a better man:
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


MMMMLII - "SSSHAKENASIBYY"

  Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
  And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
  Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Not portable, lie under this report:
  And least proportion of humanity:
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  I can no longer brook thy vanities.
  Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
  Yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
  You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.


MMMMLIII - "OURSYOUVEPASSD"

  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Shall secretly into the bosom creep
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
  Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;
  Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame,
  Dim register and notary of shame!


MMMMLIV - "AHELLOFTIMEAND"

  As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
  For I can guess that by thy honest aid
  That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!


MMMMLV - "IATYRANTHAVENO"

  I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
  And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
  They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
  No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.
  And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.


MMMMLVI - "LEISURETAKENTO"

  Leave off discourse of disability:
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  In all submission and humility
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  Thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs
  As he will have me, how am I so poor?
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  O heavy times, begetting such events!


MMMMLVII - "WEIGHHOWONCEIS"

  When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.
  Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
  He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
  How long within this wood intend you stay?
  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
  Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
  O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  I lose myself: better I were not yours
  She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.


MMMMLVIII - "UFFEREDINYOURC"

  Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
  Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
  For it no form delivers to the heart
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
  O insupportable and touching loss!
  Using no other weapon but his name.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Casca will tell us what the matter is.


MMMMLIX - "RIMEOTHATOURNI"

  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  I moralize two meanings in one word.
  My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Talkers are no good doers: be assured
  He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
  And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Under these hard conditions as this time
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  I'll send him certain word of my success.


MMMMLX - "GHTOFWOEMIGHTH"

  Give entertainment to the might of it,
  Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
  Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
  What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
  On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
  Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
  Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.


MMMMLXI - "AVEREMEMBERDMY"

  A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Myself disgraced, and the nobility
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Making them proud of his humility,
  But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed
  My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.


MMMMLXII - "DEEPESTSENSEHO"

  Do I put up that womanly defence,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Pinched with the colic, you make faces like
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
  That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
  So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
  O you immortal gods! I will not go.


MMMMLXIII - "WHARDTRUESORRO"

  Whose tenors and particular effects
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
  And so farewell until I meet thee next.
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  To tread a measure with you on this grass.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
  Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!


MMMMLXIV - "WHITSANDSOONTO"

  Which out of daily fortune ever taints
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  If you will now unite in your complaints,
  Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
  Seditious to his grace and to the state.
  O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
  Of my consent that she should be your wife.


MMMMLXV - "YOUASYOUTOMETH"

  You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
  O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
  Under your great command. You are to know
  And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
  So full of dismal terror was the time!
  Yet have I gold flies from another coast;
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.


MMMMLXVI - "ENTENDERDTHEHU"

  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  No more of this; it does offend my heart:
  Do you set down your name in the scroll of
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.


MMMMLXVII - "MBLESLAVEWHICH"

  My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
  Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
  Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  How far that little candle throws his beams!


MMMMLXVIII - "WOUNDEDBOSOMSF"

  What shall I do to win my lord again?
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Until you see her die again; for then
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
  Besides, it should appear, that if he had
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
  Still and contemplative in living art.
  For by his face straight shall you know his heart.


MMMMLXIX - "ITSBUTTHATYOUR"

  I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
  Than public means which public manners breeds.
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
  Under your testy humour? By the gods
  To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
  And we will nothing waste till you return.
  The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  Upon mine honour, he shall never know
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.


MMMMLXX - "TRESPASSNOWBEC"

  Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
  Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.
  And well said too; for who shall go about
  Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
  Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
  Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  What merit's in that reason which denies
  But shall be render'd to your public laws
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  Come, side by side together live and die.


MMMMLXXI - "OMESAFEEMINERA"

  O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
  Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  So that the ram that batters down the wall,
  And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
  France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
  In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  And am not I a prelate of the church?


MMMMLXXII - "NSOMSYOURSANDY"

  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
  Saving your mincing, the capacity
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  And so I love and honour thee and thine,
  Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
  Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.


MMMMLXXIII - "OURSMUSTRANSOM"

  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Should of another therefore be abused!
  More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
  Not like to me, or any of my kin,
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  My will is something sorted with his wish.


MMMMLXXIV - "METISBETTERTOB"

  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  In the remembrance of a weeping queen.
  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
  These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?


MMMMLXXV - "EVILETHANVILEE"

  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  To stay him from the fall of vanity:
  Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
  And least proportion of humanity:
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  If thou dost find him tractable to us,
  Let them not live to taste this land's increase
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMMLXXVI - "STEEMDWHENNOTT"

  Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
  That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  March by us, that we may peruse the men
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Win straying souls with modesty again,
  He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Now all is done, have what shall have no end:
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
  To tread a measure with her on this grass.


MMMMLXXVII - "OBERECEIVESREP"

  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Pray you, what thinks he of our estate?


MMMMLXXVIII - "ROACHOFBEINGAN"

  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
  A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
  Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
  How could he stay till Warwick made return?
  Or who should study to prefer a peace.
  Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
  Being the time the potion's force should cease.
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
  And there an end; but now they rise again,
  No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.


MMMMLXXIX - "DTHEJUSTPLEASU"

  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  They crave to be demanded. Who is this
  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,
  Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
  So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
  Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
  Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  And for thy life let justice be accused.
  Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
  Until thy head be circled with the same.


MMMMLXXX - "RELOSTWHICHISS"

  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
  Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
  Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
  Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
  Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
  Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
  Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.


MMMMLXXXI - "ODEEMDNOTBYOUR"

  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
  Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
  Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
  But then AEneas bare a living load,
  You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.


MMMMLXXXII - "FEELINGBUTBYOT"

  For they are actions that a man might play;
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  Think, how thou stab'dst me in my prime of youth
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell
  Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.


MMMMLXXXIII - "HERSSEEINGFORW"

  Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
  Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  From Rome all season'd office and to wind
  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Who is it that can tell me who I am?


MMMMLXXXIV - "HYSHOULDOTHERS"

  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  You are deceived; my child is none of his:
  So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
  How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Until your lordship came to see his death;
  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
  Or whether 'twas report of her success;
  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  He will allow no speech, which I do guess
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!


MMMMLXXXV - "FALSEADULTERAT"

  For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
  And live a coward in thine own esteem,
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.
  Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  And make a sop of all this solid globe:
  That did disrobe the lion of that robe!


MMMMLXXXVI - "EEYESGIVESALUT"

  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  England shall double gild his treble guilt;
  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
  That could be moved to smile at any thing.


MMMMLXXXVII - "ATIONTOMYSPORT"

  After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
  The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
  Is this the man that you did tell us of?
  Of thy nativity! I would the milk
  None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
  Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
  One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
  More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
  Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
  Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.


MMMMLXXXVIII - "IVEBLOODORONMY"

  If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
  Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
  Of disobedient opposition
  Of noble blood in this declining land.
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
  No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  You shall confess that you are both deceived.


MMMMLXXXIX - "FRAILTIESWHYAR"

  From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
  I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
  Led by a delicate and tender prince,
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  I heard no letter from my master since
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
  With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
  Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
  Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
  And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!


MMMMXC - "EFRAILERSPIESW"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
  It sends some precious instance of itself
  Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
  Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
  If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
  What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?


MMMMXCI - "HICHINTHEIRWIL"

  How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
  I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
  Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Into the law of children. Be not fond,
  Not working with the eye without the ear,
  Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
  I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.


MMMMXCII - "LSCOUNTBADWHAT"

  Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  Caesar and Antony have ever won
  O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
  Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
  Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  Thy honourable metal may be wrought
  But since correction lieth in those hands
  A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
  How have I been behaved, that he might stick
  And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.


MMMMXCIII - "ITHINKGOODNOIA"

  I see a woman may be made a fool
  That only to stand high in your account,
  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
  I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
  Never so much as in a thought unborn
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
  Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
  O, how I long to have some chat with her!
  In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?


MMMMXCIV - "MTHATIAMANDTHE"

  My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
  Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  And not have title of an earldom here.
  To the ambassadors of England gives
  I will resist such entertainment till
  And her immortal part with angels lives.
  More than enough am I that vex thee still,
  After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
  Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
  Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
  Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
  He wishes earnestly you never may.
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMMMXCV - "YTHATLEVELATMY"

  You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
  Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
  And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
  The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
  Am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
  To whom I am so infinitely bound.
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.


MMMMXCVI - "ABUSESRECKONUP"

  As we do trace this alley up and down,
  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
  Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
  Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  Presented to the tears of soft remorse.


MMMMXCVII - "THEIROWNIMAYBE"

  Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  Without her love; for her employ them all;
  Not all together: better far, I guess,
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  My message must return from whence it came.
  And of so easy and so plain a stop
  Yet one time he did call me by my name:
  By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMMXCVIII - "STRAIGHTTHOUGH"

  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  That I some lady trifles have reserved,
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
  In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
  Grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
  Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
  Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  Of disobedient opposition
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?


MMMMXCIX - "THEYTHEMSELVES"

  Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  His antidotes are poison, and he slays
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
  To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
  Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.


MMMMC - "BEBEVELBYTHEIR"

  By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  But your request shall make me let it pass.
  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


MMMMCI - "RANKTHOUGHTSMY"

  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  They know their master loves to be aloft,
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
  Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
  Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
  Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
  You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.


MMMMCII - "DEEDSMUSTNOTBE"

  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
  There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
  Now is she in the very lists of love,
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
  But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMMMCIII - "SHOWNUNLESSTHI"

  So that from point to point now have you heard
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
  Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
  Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:
  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
  Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
  I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.


MMMMCIV - "SGENERALEVILTH"

  So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
  Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
  And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
  Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  It may be good: pride hath no other glass
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
  He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.


MMMMCV - "EYMAINTAINALLM"

  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  That rage in savage sensuality.
  A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
  It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.


MMMMCVI - "ENAREBADANDINT"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  And, by the necessary form of this,
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
  Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
  Death is the fairest cover for her shame
  In that it scorns to bear another hue;
  No might nor greatness in mortality
  That rage in savage sensuality.


MMMMCVII - "HEIRBADNESSREI"

  Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
  Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.
  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
  Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  I have the patience to endure it now.


MMMMCVIII - "GNTHYGIFTTHYTA"

  Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
  Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
  Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
  He had the wit which I can well observe
  You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
  God's benison go with you; and with those
  I would entreat you rather to put on
  For who love I so much? And now who knows
  This day those enemies are put to death,
  That in their kind they speak it: only sin
  Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
  You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
  Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
  As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.


MMMMCIX - "BLESAREWITHINM"

  Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
  In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?


MMMMCX - "YBRAINFULLCHAR"

  Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
  But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
  Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
  Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:
  For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,
  Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
  Let's have your company, or, if you please,
  Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
  Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
  Her mother hath many times told me so.
  And those his golden beams to you here lent
  Repair'd with double riches of content.


MMMMCXI - "ACTERDWITHLAST"

  As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
  Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
  That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
  Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
  And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
  Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief!


MMMMCXII - "INGMEMORYWHICH"

  I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  My father's purposes have been mistook;
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
  We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
  He doth intend she shall be England's queen.


MMMMCXIII - "SHALLABOVETHAT"

  Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  Lady, you know no rules of charity,
  Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
  At last she sees a wretched image bound,
  Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
  How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
  And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
  Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.


MMMMCXIV - "IDLERANKREMAIN"

  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Deny your asking: take your choice of those
  Labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  And now the happy season once more fits,
  Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
  Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
  Repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Make something nothing by augmenting it.
  And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;
  I know this act shows horrible and grim.
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.


MMMMCXV - "BEYONDALLDATEE"

  Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
  A thievish living on the common road?
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
  Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
  A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
  To blot old books and alter their contents,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMMCXVI - "VENTOETERNITYO"

  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
  Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Remember so weak a composition.
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  I would not my unhoused free condition
  Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
  Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
  O any thing, of nothing first create!


MMMMCXVII - "RATTHELEASTSOL"

  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
  That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
  The chain were longer and the letter short?
  How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  To make a shaking fever in your walls,
  Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  Like captives bound to a triumphant car.


MMMMCXVIII - "ONGASBRAINANDH"

  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  Neither entitled in the other's heart.
  God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
  Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
  I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  And underneath that consecrated roof,
  Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
  Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.


MMMMCXIX - "EARTHAVEFACULT"

  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
  Remember that you call on me to-day:
  Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
  He, being in the vaward, placed behind
  Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
  And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?


MMMMCXX - "YBYNATURETOSUB"

  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
  Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
  Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
  And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
  To view the field in safety and dispose
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
  Of many worthy fellows that were out;
  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
  Upon whose property and most dear life
  But twenty times so much upon my wife.


MMMMCXXI - "SISTTILLEACHTO"

  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
  She is importunate, indeed distract.
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  I have a kind of self resides with you;
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  A lute-string and now governed by stops.
  Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
  O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?


MMMMCXXII - "RAZEDOBLIVIONY"

  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
  Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
  O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
  But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
  Let it command a mirror hither straight,
  I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  Nor would your noble mother for much more
  Your highness told me I should post before.


MMMMCXXIII - "IELDHISPARTOFT"

  I am ambitious for a motley coat.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
  He did solicit you in free contempt
  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
  An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
  Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.


MMMMCXXIV - "HEETHYRECORDNE"

  He is but one: you and my brother search
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  To lesson me and tell me some good mean
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
  Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Deliver him to safety; and return,
  Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMCXXV - "VERCANBEMISSDT"

  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
  I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  The king was slily finger'd from the deck!


MMMMCXXVI - "HATPOORRETENTI"

  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
  The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
  Presume not that I am the thing I was,
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Till he behold them form'd in the applause
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  That I should seem to lack humanity
  I can no longer brook thy vanities.


MMMMCXXVII - "ONCOULDNOTSOMU"

  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Containing the deposing of a king
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
  Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?


MMMMCXXVIII - "CHHOLDNORNEEDI"

  Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
  Hostility and civil tumult reigns
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
  No, holy father; throw away that thought;
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  I could marry this wench for this device.


MMMMCXXIX - "TALLIESTHYDEAR"

  That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
  Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.


MMMMCXXX - "LOVETOSCORETHE"

  Love loving not itself none other can.
  Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
  Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
  Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
  Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
  O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
  Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MMMMCXXXI - "REFORETOGIVETH"

  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
  Out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
  God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!
  Insinuation, parley and base truce
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  To outface me with leaping in her grave?
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.


MMMMCXXXII - "EMFROMMEWASIBO"

  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Might there not be a charity in sin
  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
  And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
  But if thy love were ever like to mine,
  Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?


MMMMCXXXIII - "LDTOTRUSTTHOSE"

  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
  That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
  On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
  The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
  There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMMCXXXIV - "TABLESTHATRECE"

  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  And dress'd myself in such humility
  Because it is a customary cross,
  Losing both beauty and utility.
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
  There is no malice in this burning coal;
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMMCXXXV - "IVETHEEMORETOK"

  If he see aught in you that makes him like,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  My heart as great, my reason haply more,
  Of thy deep duty more impression show
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,
  Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.


MMMMCXXXVI - "EEPANADJUNCTTO"

  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
  And they have served me to effectless use:
  Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
  And but attended by a simple guard,
  Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
  Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
  To work exceeding miracles on earth.
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  O, full of careful business are his looks!


MMMMCXXXVII - "REMEMBERTHEEWE"

  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
  Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMCXXXVIII - "RETOIMPORTFORG"

  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.
  My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;
  Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
  That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
  For living idly here in pomp and ease,
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Give me superfluous death.  A noise within.


MMMMCXXXIX - "ETFULNESSINMEN"

  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Thy will by my performance shall be served:
  For, as I think, they do command him home,
  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
  No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
  She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
  Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.


MMMMCXL - "OTIMETHOUSHALT"

  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  This interchange of love, I here protest,
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Must for your victory us all congest,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
  How have I been behaved, that he might stick
  Other offenders we will pause upon.
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
  And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.


MMMMCXLI - "NOTBOASTTHATID"

  Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
  Of thy deep duty more impression show
  The repetition, in a woman's ear,
  By which he should revive: and even so
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
  Shall as a pattern or a measure live
  That he did pace them first? All things that are,
  To make the sceptre his: these very words
  His resemblance, being not like the duke;
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
  Distasted with the salt of broken tears.


MMMMCXLII - "OCHANGETHYPYRA"

  Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
  Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
  He that a fool doth very wisely hit
  And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.
  Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  And here my brother, weeping at my woes.


MMMMCXLIII - "MIDSBUILTUPWIT"

  Matter against me; and his eye reviled
  I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
  Duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
  But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
  Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
  Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
  I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
  Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.


MMMMCXLIV - "HNEWERMIGHTTOM"

  Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
  Now spurs the lated traveller apace
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  My sword, made weak by my affection, would
  Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
  Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
  Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
  Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Of health and living now begins to mend,
  My guilt be on my head, and there an end.


MMMMCXLV - "EARENOTHINGNOV"

  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
  That virtue must go through. We must not stint
  How many be commanded that command!
  I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
  Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMMMCXLVI - "ELNOTHINGSTRAN"

  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Legitimation, name and all is gone:
  Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
  And ask remission for my folly past.
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?


MMMMCXLVII - "GETHEYAREBUTDR"

  Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
  Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  Your visitation shall receive such thanks
  Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
  Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMMCXLVIII - "ESSINGSOFAFORM"

  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  So likely an ambassador of love:
  Swear in both the scales against either scale;
  If I do feign, you witnesses above
  Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is
  Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
  And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
  For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?


MMMMCXLIX - "ERSIGHTOURDATE"

  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
  It follows then the cat must stay at home:
  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  The very faculties of eyes and ears.
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
  As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.


MMMMCL - "SAREBRIEFANDTH"

  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
  And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  But I will find him when he lies asleep,
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  For that which, if myself might be his judge,
  As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
  He's a disease that must be cut away.


MMMMCLI - "EREFOREWEADMIR"

  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Falsely to take away a life true made
  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
  I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


MMMMCLII - "EWHATTHOUDOSTF"

  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
  That were unworthy to behold the same?
  That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
  Having his ear full of his airy fame,
  Or else he must not only die the death,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  The king is full of grace and fair regard.
  Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.


MMMMCLIII - "OISTUPONUSTHAT"

  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
  Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
  Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
  Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
  Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  That she should lock herself from his resort,
  Happy the parents of so fair a child;
  And one man's lust these many lives confounds:
  There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.


MMMMCLIV - "ISOLDANDRATHER"

  It sends some precious instance of itself
  Successful in the battles that he fights,
  O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
  Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Away! for everything is seal'd and done
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  And made defeat of her virginity,--
  To have their unseen sin remain untold;
  Hear him but reason in divinity,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?


MMMMCLV - "MAKETHEMBORNTO"

  My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
  And bids you be advised there's nought in France
  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
  Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  No lady closer; for I well believe
  The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
  O, thou wilt be a wilderness again.


MMMMCLVI - "OURDESIRETHANT"

  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Still live they and for ever may they last!
  Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
  How fine my master is! I am afraid
  Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.
  Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
  The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?


MMMMCLVII - "HINKTHATWEBEFO"

  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
  Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
  To think upon the part of business which
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  And say there is no sin but to be rich;
  Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
  O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!


MMMMCLVIII - "REHAVEHEARDTHE"

  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
  And process of this time, you can report,
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
  Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
  His servant live, and will his vassal die:
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMMCLIX - "MTOLDTHYREGIST"

  Most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
  To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
  Tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  You tread upon my patience: but be sure
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  If he improve them, may well stretch so far
  Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?


MMMMCLX - "ERSANDTHEEIBOT"

  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  And salt too little which may season give
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  It is not so with Him that all things knows
  Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
  O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
  The boy gives warning something doth approach.


MMMMCLXI - "HDEFYNOTWONDER"

  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
  What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
  Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.


MMMMCLXII - "INGATTHEPRESEN"

  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
  The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  He that flies so will ne'er return again.
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.


MMMMCLXIII - "TNORTHEPASTFOR"

  That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
  Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
  He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
  And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
  Success and conquest to attend on us.
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  For man or master. Then it follows thus:
  O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MMMMCLXIV - "THYRECORDSANDW"

  The injuries that they themselves procure
  He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
  You tread upon my patience: but be sure
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Crave harbourage within your city walls.
  O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Anon, as patient as the female dove
  No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.


MMMMCLXV - "HATWESEEDOTHLI"

  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
  That I will show you shining at this feast,
  With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.


MMMMCLXVI - "EMADEMOREORLES"

  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  As did that one; and that, in my regard,
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
  O sacred receptacle of my joys,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!


MMMMCLXVII - "SBYTHYCONTINUA"

  Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
  Younger than she are happy mothers made.
  Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
  Cause the musicians play me that sad note
  On what condition stands it and wherein?
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
  In the most terrible and nimble stroke
  Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
  Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  And from his bosom purge this black despair!


MMMMCLXVIII - "LHASTETHISIDOV"

  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
  Her ashes new create another heir,
  In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.


MMMMCLXIX - "OWANDTHISSHALL"

  O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
  What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
  And at her heels a huge infectious troop
  No danger in what show of death it makes,
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
  Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!


MMMMCLXX - "EVERBEIWILLBET"

  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Behold another day break in the east:
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
  Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
  I put myself to thy direction, and
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
  Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  That comes to hazard for my worthless self.


MMMMCLXXI - "RUEDESPITETHYS"

  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
  Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  If that his Majesty would aught with us,
  To reason most absurd, whose common theme
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  This sudden sending him away must seem
  He entertain'd a show so seeming just,
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.


MMMMCLXXII - "CYTHEANDTHEEIF"

  Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
  Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And though we lay these honours on this man,
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?


MMMMCLXXIII - "MYDEARLOVEWERE"

  Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.
  Your potent and infectious fevers heap
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Attested by the holy close of lips,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?


MMMMCLXXIV - "BUTTHECHILDOFS"

  Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
  Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
  This body, like to them, to what I must;
  The purest spring is not so free from mud
  How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Have they been merry! which their keepers call
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
  So he were like him and by Venus' side.


MMMMCLXXV - "TATEITMIGHTFOR"

  Then others for the breath of words respect,
  And yet a dispensation may be had.
  That Cupid will impose for my neglect
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
  Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
  My father's purposes have been mistook;
  I have forgot why I did call thee back.
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  How shall that faith return again to earth,
  This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,
  Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.


MMMMCLXXVI - "FORTUNESBASTAR"

  For God he knows, and you may partly see,
  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  Return again, and take an oath with thee.
  To stay him from the fall of vanity:
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
  But in despair die under their black weight.
  And of such great authority in France
  Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
  Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
  And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMMCLXXVII - "DBEUNFATHERDAS"

  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
  But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
  He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
  And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
  Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.


MMMMCLXXVIII - "SUBJECTTOTIMES"

  So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Before the always wind-obeying deep
  Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
  That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
  That have beheld me give away myself
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  That I will show you shining at this feast,
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  So is my love still telling what is told.


MMMMCLXXIX - "LOVEORTOTIMESH"

  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  Of all treasons, we still see them reveal
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  That yarely frame the office. From the barge
  O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
  To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
  I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
  My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  How would it fare with your departed souls?


MMMMCLXXX - "ATEWEEDSAMONGW"

  As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
  That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
  My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.


MMMMCLXXXI - "EEDSORFLOWERSW"

  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Do shameful execution on herself.
  Say they be fled; Germans are honest men.
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
  Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
  Walk under his huge legs and peep about
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  What is the body when the head is off?


MMMMCLXXXII - "ITHFLOWERSGATH"

  Into the purse of rich prosperity
  The very bottom and the soul of hope,
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  From this my hand, as holding of the pope
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
  Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  How he received you, let me be resolved.


MMMMCLXXXIII - "ERDNOITWASBUIL"

  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  Of the all-building law; and that there were
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
  What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
  But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  Is there no voice more worthy than my own
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.


MMMMCLXXXIV - "DEDFARFROMACCI"

  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Discredit more in hiding of the fault
  For in my death I murder shameful scorn:
  And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  From this time forth I never will speak word.
  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
  Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
  My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
  And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
  Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.
  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  I thank my God for my humility.


MMMMCLXXXV - "DENTITSUFFERSN"

  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
  That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
  For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
  For I would commune with you of such things
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.


MMMMCLXXXVI - "OTINSMILINGPOM"

  Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
  The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
  In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
  Man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
  I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  If there be nothing new, but that which is
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.


MMMMCLXXXVII - "PNORFALLSUNDER"

  Praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  For nothing canst thou to damnation add
  And their gross painting might be better used
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Let them not cease, but with a din confused
  Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMMMCLXXXVIII - "THEBLOWOFTHRAL"

  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  He goes before me and still dares me on:
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
  When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  For exile hath more terror in his look,
  The state and inclination of the day:
  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
  Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.


MMMMCLXXXIX - "LEDDISCONTENTW"

  Labouring men; and therefore should we be
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
  Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
  Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
  O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  To draw conditions of a friendly peace;
  We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.


MMMMCXC - "HERETOTHEINVIT"

  Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  I would not be sir Nob in any case.
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.


MMMMCXCI - "INGTIMEOURFASH"

  I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
  I do not much dislike the matter, but
  March patiently along: let one be sent
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
  As they were living; think you see them great,
  Study to break it and not break my troth.
  How much in duty I am bound to both.


MMMMCXCII - "IONCALLSITFEAR"

  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
  Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
  Last, and as much containing as all these,
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  Should a like language use to all degrees
  I hear the King my father is sore sick.
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  As may beseem some well-reputed page.
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!


MMMMCXCIII - "SNOTPOLICYTHAT"

  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
  Next month? and are they not some of them set
  Of any thing the image tell me that
  The barren tender of a poet's debt;
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
  Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
  Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
  Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
  That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
  Have lost their quality, and that this day
  Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
  The treasury of everlasting joy.


MMMMCXCIV - "HERETICWHICHWO"

  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  The money that you owe me for the chain.
  It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
  Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
  Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
  How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
  I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
  Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
  O, they love least that let men know their love.


MMMMCXCV - "RKSONLEASESOFS"

  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  For lovers ever run before the clock.
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.


MMMMCXCVI - "HORTNUMBERDHOU"

  How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
  Or by the father there were none at all;
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
  Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
  Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
  My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
  Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
  O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.


MMMMCXCVII - "RSBUTALLALONES"

  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
  Be any further moved. What you have said
  Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  And for your rapier most especially,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Labour and effect one thing specially.
  And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
  Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.


MMMMCXCVIII - "TANDSHUGELYPOL"

  To whom this wreath of victory I give,
  And suddenly; where injury of chance
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
  Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
  Past all expressing. It is very meet
  Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.


MMMMCXCIX - "ITICTHATITNORG"

  I think would better please 'em: by my life,
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
  Correction and instruction must both work
  The cause were known to them it most concerns;
  Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
  And thanks; and ever thanks; and oft good turns
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
  That they lost France and made his England bleed:
  Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


MMMMCC - "ROWSWITHHEATNO"

  Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
  I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
  This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
  How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
  He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Another thing to fall. I not deny,
  Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!


MMMMCCI - "RDROWNSWITHSHO"

  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Drest in a little brief authority,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
  Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
  The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.


MMMMCCII - "WERSTOTHISIWIT"

  Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
  Environed with a wilderness of sea,
  Richer than that which four successive kings
  Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  That scolds against the quality of flesh,
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.


MMMMCCIII - "NESSCALLTHEFOO"

  Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,
  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
  Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
  To keep in darkness what occasion now
  He couples it to his complaining names.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
  Or in my life what comfort, when I am
  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?


MMMMCCIV - "LSOFTIMEWHICHD"

  Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again
  So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
  Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
  For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
  May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  When in that moment, so it came to pass,
  He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
  He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?


MMMMCCV - "IEFORGOODNESSW"

  In argument and proof of which contract,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
  O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Set down, set down your honourable load,
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!


MMMMCCVI - "HOHAVELIVEDFOR"

  Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  And your lips too; for I am well assured
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  From this time forth I never will speak word.
  O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMMCCVII - "CRIMEWERETAUGH"

  Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  If it be honour in your wars to seem
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,
  And blood untainted still doth red abide,
  Under a cloak that is of any length.
  God forbid any malice should prevail,
  Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?


MMMMCCVIII - "TTOMEIBORETHEC"

  To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;
  To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
  But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
  O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
  His insolence draws folly from my lips;
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.


MMMMCCIX - "ANOPYWITHMYEXT"

  Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  O, well did he become that lion's robe
  Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
  Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like
  I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
 eXcited me to treason: their dear loss,
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.


MMMMCCX - "ERNTHEOUTWARDH"

  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
  Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
  Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
  Unto your Grace do I in chief address
  The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
  With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
  Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
  Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.


MMMMCCXI - "ONOURINGORLAID"

  O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
  No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  I hope I have your good will, father Page.
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  Or whether revolution be the same.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
  And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.


MMMMCCXII - "GREATBASESFORE"

  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
  Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
  But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
  And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
  She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
  Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMMCCXIII - "TERNITYWHICHPR"

  To hear the replication of your sounds
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  No court, no father; nor no more ado
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  The like allayment could I give my grief.
  Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
  Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
  He hath brought many captives home to Rome
  I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
  Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMMMCCXIV - "OVEMORESHORTTH"

  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
  Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
  Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Throng her inventions, which shall go before.
  Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?


MMMMCCXV - "ANWASTEORRUINI"

  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Where that and other specialties are bound:
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
  I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
  Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
  In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.


MMMMCCXVI - "NGHAVEINOTSEEN"

  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
  Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
  And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  I cannot but remember such things were,
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.


MMMMCCXVII - "DWELLERSONFORM"

  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
  On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
  Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
  From his ambitious finger. What had he
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  My guilt be on my head, and there an end.


MMMMCCXVIII - "ANDFAVOURLOSEA"

  Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  For such things in a false disloyal knave
  And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
  On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.


MMMMCCXIX - "LLANDMOREBYPAY"

  Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
  Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
  Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
  Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
  Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
  Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
  And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:
  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.


MMMMCCXX - "INGTOOMUCHRENT"

  I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.
  To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
  Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
  He does fair justice; if he give me way,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  That oft they interchange each other's seat.


MMMMCCXXI - "FORCOMPOUNDSWE"

  For the base matter to illuminate
  Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
  Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
  My lords ambassadors, your several suits
  Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
  When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMMCCXXII - "ETFORGOINGSIMP"

  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
  From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
  O, what authority and show of truth
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
  If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
  Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
  Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?


MMMMCCXXIII - "LESAVOURPITIFU"

  Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  And am so near the lack of charity--
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
  I will converse with iron-witted fools
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
  For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.


MMMMCCXXIV - "LTHRIVERSINTHE"

  Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  How have I been behaved, that he might stick
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
  I do beseech you, madam, be content.
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
  How I may bear me here: my prime request,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMCCXXV - "IRGAZINGSPENTN"

  If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
  Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:
  And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
  If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
  No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
  Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
  Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.


MMMMCCXXVI - "OLETMEBEOBSEQU"

  O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
  Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  By such poor passion as the maid that milks
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
  Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!


MMMMCCXXVII - "IOUSINTHYHEART"

  I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  She's such a one, that, were I well assured
  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
  His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
  Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,
  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
  That put Armado's page out of his part!


MMMMCCXXVIII - "ANDTAKETHOUMYO"

  Account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Do no more offices of life to't than
  That, from the sense of all civility,
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!
  Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
  Each day still better other's happiness;
  This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,
  How it goes with us, and do look to know
  Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  Up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
  My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
  Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
  O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.


MMMMCCXXIX - "BLATIONPOORBUT"

  Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  That the fixed sentinels almost receive
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
  Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
  Of those that claim their offices this day
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
  But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are.


MMMMCCXXX - "FREEWHICHISNOT"

  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
  Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
  Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
  Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
  Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  The noble duke hath been too much abused.


MMMMCCXXXI - "MIXDWITHSECOND"

  Misprising what they look on, and her wit
  I rather of his absence make this use:
 eXcept a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
  I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
  This honourable bounty shall belong:
  How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!


MMMMCCXXXII - "SKNOWSNOARTBUT"

  Stain'd with the variation of each soil
  Know you how much the people may be moved
  No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
  Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  And that's the mark I know you level at:
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
  Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
  But what a fool am I to chat with you,
  Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
  That's he that was Othello: here I am.


MMMMCCXXXIII - "MUTUALRENDERON"

  Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
  Under a cloak that is of any length.
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
  Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
  Not seeing what is likely to ensue.


MMMMCCXXXIV - "LYMEFORTHEEHEN"

  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  For long agone I have forgot to court;
  Of our restored love and amity.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.
  His rudeness so with his authorized youth
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.


MMMMCCXXXV - "CETHOUSUBORNDI"

  Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
  Should many people, under two commands,
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.


MMMMCCXXXVI - "NFORMERATRUESO"

  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
  And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
  To any shape of thy preferment such
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.


MMMMCCXXXVII - "ULWHENMOSTIMPE"

  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  With all the gracious utterance thou hast
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
  O, they love least that let men know their love.
  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
  That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
  In your denial I would find no sense;
  My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
  Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MMMMCCXXXVIII - "ACHDSTANDSLEAS"

  Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
  Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
  Depart again: here, here will I remain
  So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,
  So is it not with me as with that Muse
  Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  A lullaby too rough: I never saw
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.


MMMMCCXXXIX - "TINTHYCONTROLO"

  To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
  If you deny me, fie upon your law!
  Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
  You use in abject and in slavish parts,
  Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
  Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
  On what condition stands it and wherein?


MMMMCCXL - "THOUMYLOVELYBO"

  The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
  His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Long die thy happy days before thy death;
  Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
  Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.


MMMMCCXLI - "YWHOINTHYPOWER"

  Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
  Whose names are written there, and to them say,
  Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
  Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
  Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
  Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
  We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MMMMCCXLII - "DOSTHOLDTIMESF"

  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  Their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
  Horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
  O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
  Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
  Denied me to come in) return, and force
  To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass
  I like this well; he will return again.
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.


MMMMCCXLIII - "ICKLEGLASSHISS"

  If this be error and upon me proved,
  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  Know you how much the people may be moved
  Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
  Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
  And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
  Swear in both the scales against either scale;
  So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
  If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.


MMMMCCXLIV - "ICKLEHOURWHOHA"

  I do embrace your offer; and dispose
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
  How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
  Only, good master, while we do admire
  He never would have stay'd in France so long.
  And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.


MMMMCCXLV - "STBYWANINGGROW"

  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
  But I will rule both her, the king and realm.
  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
  As the death-bed whereon it must expire
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
  No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
  Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:
  Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.


MMMMCCXLVI - "NANDTHEREINSHO"

  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
  And in regard of causes now in hand,
  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
  Disguise the holy strength of their command,
  That this my mother's son was none of his;
  Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
  Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.


MMMMCCXLVII - "WSTTHYLOVERSWI"

  Which out of daily fortune ever taints
  So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
  Together with the pitiful complaints
  The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Send for the county; go tell him of this:
  What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
  It is my fashion, when I see a crab.


MMMMCCXLVIII - "THERINGASTHYSW"

  The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
  Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
  Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
  Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
  And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
  Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
  The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
  Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
  Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.


MMMMCCXLIX - "EETSELFGROWSTI"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  The pretty follies that themselves commit;
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  For thy records and what we see doth lie,
  God and King Henry govern England's realm.
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  What would your grace have done unto him now?
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  That, if it chance the one of us do fail,
  I do obey thee till I give thee bail.


MMMMCCL - "FNATURESOVEREI"

  For this they have been thoughtful to invest
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Am bold to show myself a forward guest
  The hateful commons will perform for us,
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.


MMMMCCLI - "GNMISTRESSOVER"

  Good parts did you first suffer love for me?
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  Marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
  I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
  She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
  That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
  Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


MMMMCCLII - "WRACKASTHOUGOE"

  Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  And woes by wrong imaginations lose
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  And must be made a subject to a duke?
  So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MMMMCCLIII - "STONWARDSSTILL"

  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  That what we have we prize not to the worth
  Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  Was never subject long'd to be a king
  And for his safety there I'll best devise.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
  That can assure my daughter greatest dower
  If once it be neglected, ten to one
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.


MMMMCCLIV - "WILLPLUCKTHEEB"

  Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
  Inferring arguments of mighty force.
  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
  Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Caesar and Antony have ever won
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
  He falls to such perusal of my face
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  But by reflection, by some other things.


MMMMCCLV - "ACKSHEKEEPSTHE"

  As shaming any eye should thee behold,
  Call in the letters patent that he hath
  Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
  Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
  Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
  Sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
  That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
  How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMMMCCLVI - "ETOTHISPURPOSE"

  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  That by thy comfortable beams I may
  Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
  I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
  Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
  O heavy times, begetting such events!
  Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMMCCLVII - "THATHERSKILLMA"

  That you and I should meet upon such terms
  Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
  And what we do establish he confirms:
  Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
  Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
  Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
  And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.


MMMMCCLVIII - "YTIMEDISGRACEA"

  You have not dared to break the holy seal
  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
  Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
  Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
  A thousand times, and now no more reflect;
  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.


MMMMCCLIX - "NDWRETCHEDMINU"

  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
  Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
  Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
  Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
  My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.


MMMMCCLX - "TESKILLYETFEAR"

  That will with two pernicious daughters join
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
  Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
  If his chief good and market of his time
  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
  Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
  You have a double tongue within your mask,
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!


MMMMCCLXI - "HEROTHOUMINION"

  Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Under that colour am I come to scale
  My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
  It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
  Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?


MMMMCCLXII - "OFHERPLEASURES"

  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
  Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
  How have you made division of yourself?
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
  Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.


MMMMCCLXIII - "HEMAYDETAINBUT"

  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
  You have the honey still, but these the gall;
  Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
  Upon the dancing banners of the French,
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.


MMMMCCLXIV - "NOTSTILLKEEPHE"

  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  On either side I come to spend my breath;
  Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:
  Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
  That with the hurly death itself awakes?
  It would not out at windows nor at doors.
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  How might a prince of my great hopes forget
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMMCCLXV - "RTREASUREHERAU"

  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Romans, forget your fealty to me.
  Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
  Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.


MMMMCCLXVI - "DITTHOUGHDELAY"

  Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
  I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
  Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
  That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
  Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.


MMMMCCLXVII - "DANSWERDMUSTBE"

  Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
  And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
  No harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
  So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
  Well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  During all question of the gentle truce;
  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  To hear the replication of your sounds
  But your request shall make me let it pass.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMMCCLXVIII - "ANDHERQUIETUSI"

  A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
  Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  I never read but England's kings have had
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Then were it certain you were not so bad
  Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  I wis your grandam had a worser match.


MMMMCCLXIX - "STORENDERTHEEI"

  So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
  The riches of the ship is come on shore!
  Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
  Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth.
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.


MMMMCCLXX - "NTHEOLDAGEBLAC"

  Not knowing them until we know their grave:
  They could not find a heart within the beast.
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
  Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
  Against the French, that met them in their bent,
  Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Because I would be sure to have all well,
  Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
  And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
  Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.


MMMMCCLXXI - "KWASNOTCOUNTED"

  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  With scruples and do set the word itself
  And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
  Since I am crept in favour with myself,
  No woman may approach his silent court:
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
  Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
  Of this escape and whither they are bound;
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Now do I long to hear how you were found;
  The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!


MMMMCCLXXII - "FAIRORIFITWERE"

  For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
  As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
  Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  I will respect thee as a father if
  From the dejected state wherein he is,
  In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
  That all the court may echo with the noise.
  What, is the jay more precious than the lark
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMMMCCLXXIII - "ITBORENOTBEAUT"

  Into one giant arm, it shall not force
  There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
  But by self-danger, you should tread a course
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
  Be happy that my arms are out of use:
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  The loss of such a lord includes all harm.


MMMMCCLXXIV - "YSNAMEBUTNOWIS"

  Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
  Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
  Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
  An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
  My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
  Unto the citizens, who haply may
  Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
  Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
  What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
  I should report that which I say I saw,
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.


MMMMCCLXXV - "BLACKBEAUTYSSU"

  Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And we will nothing waste till you return.
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.
  Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
  Unmeritable shuns your high request.


MMMMCCLXXVI - "CCESSIVEHEIRAN"

  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  Starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  As those should do that had deserved his hate,
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.


MMMMCCLXXVII - "DBEAUTYSLANDER"

  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  Being but the second generation
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And quench his fiery indignation
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  Strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMMMCCLXXVIII - "DWITHABASTARDS"

  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
  If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
  That I no more can see what once I was!
  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
  Are often welcomest when they are gone.
  But not so citizen a wanton as
  Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
  Set deadly enmity between two friends,
  This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  South from the mighty power of the king.


MMMMCCLXXIX - "HAMEFORSINCEEA"

  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
  May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
  One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Study to break it and not break my troth.
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.


MMMMCCLXXX - "CHHANDHATHPUTO"

  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
  And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
  Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
  And told thee to what purpose and what end.
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
  Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
  That my discovery be not aimed at;
  On what compulsion must I? tell me that.


MMMMCCLXXXI - "NNATURESPOWERF"

  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
  There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
  Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
  For live I will not, if my father die.


MMMMCCLXXXII - "AIRINGTHEFOULW"

  After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  For none offend where all alike do dote.
  Of many in the army: many years,
  Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Where you may abide till your date expire.


MMMMCCLXXXIII - "ITHARTSFALSEBO"

  I will not hence and leave my husband here:
  The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
  He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
  And will again commit them to their bonds,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.
  Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
  From thence to England; where I hope ere long
  As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  By all the battles wherein we have fought,
  O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!


MMMMCCLXXXIV - "RROWDFACESWEET"

  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Or by the father there were none at all;
  Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,
  Do the part of an honest man in it.
  For that which now torments me to rehearse:
  A man already made, as to remit
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.


MMMMCCLXXXV - "BEAUTYHATHNONA"

  Before I be convict by course of law,
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
  His resemblance, being not like the duke;
  And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.


MMMMCCLXXXVI - "MENOHOLYBOWERB"

  My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
  Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
  He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
  Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
  But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
  O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
  Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.


MMMMCCLXXXVII - "UTISPROFANEDIF"

  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
  The extreme parts of time extremely forms
  I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
  Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
  From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
  And art confederate with a damned pack
  No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
  It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
  Find written in the margent of his eyes.


MMMMCCLXXXVIII - "NOTLIVESINDISG"

  Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
  O, let my sovereign turn away his face
  There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
  Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
  I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
  I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
  Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
  Doth by the idle comments that it makes
  I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
  Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!


MMMMCCLXXXIX - "RACETHEREFOREM"

  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
  Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Think that you are upon a rock; and now
  Have you not made an universal shout,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
  Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.


MMMMCCXC - "YMISTRESSBROWS"

  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  Should not be able to encounter mine.
  By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
  Such war of white and red within her cheeks!


MMMMCCXCI - "ARERAVENBLACKH"

  Away the performance: therefore, much drink
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  And, after, meet you sooner than you would.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  No place will please me so, no mean of death,
  By him one step below, he by the next,
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.


MMMMCCXCII - "EREYESSOSUITED"

  Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  Eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
  Some airy devil hovers in the sky
  Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
  Other men fitter to go out than I.
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?


MMMMCCXCIII - "ANDTHEYMOURNER"

  A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
  Neither of either; I remit both twain.
  Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
  That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.
  Him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
  Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:
  Of any point in't shall not only be
  Unless thou let his silver water keep
  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.


MMMMCCXCIV - "SSEEMATSUCHWHO"

  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
  That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
  So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
  Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
  Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
  His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
  What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
  Have I not heard these islanders shout out
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!


MMMMCCXCV - "NOTBORNFAIRNOB"

  No grief did ever come so near thy heart
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  That put Armado's page out of his part!
  Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
  In your protectorship you did devise
  Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Old Helicanus goes along behind.
  But now you partly may perceive my mind.


MMMMCCXCVI - "EAUTYLACKSLAND"

  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
  Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
  Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
  And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
  Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
  King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
  Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
  And with a dropping industry they skip
  Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
  Definitively thus I answer you.


MMMMCCXCVII - "ERINGCREATIONW"

  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
  Not of that dye which their investments show,
  Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
  Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  And no man else hath honour by his death.
  That the magnifico is much beloved,
  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.


MMMMCCXCVIII - "ITHAFALSEESTEE"

  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
  And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
  To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MMMMCCXCIX - "MYETSOTHEYMOUR"

  Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!
  Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
  To accessary yieldings, but still pure
  He would not stay at your petitions: made
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
  Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!


MMMMCCC - "NBECOMINGOFTHE"

  Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,
  But not so citizen a wanton as
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  More said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
  Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
  No better than the earth he lies upon,
  Go speedily and bring again the count.
  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
  Tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.


MMMMCCCI - "IRWOETHATEVERY"

  If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
  Whom after under the confession's seal
  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
  As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
  The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  You may behold confusion of your foes.


MMMMCCCII - "TONGUESAYSBEAU"

  Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
  Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
  And salt too little which may season give
  You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
  Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
  But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
  Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?


MMMMCCCIII - "TYSHOULDLOOKSO"

  Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.
  You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
  So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
  Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
  O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
  Or else he never would compare between.


MMMMCCCIV - "HOWOFTWHENTHOU"

  His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
  On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
  What misadventure is so early up,
  On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
  Than is my deed to my most painted word.
  Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  The prey wherein by nature they delight;
  How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
  Of England's coat one half is cut away.
  Uncertain of the issue any way.


MMMMCCCV - "MYMUSICMUSICPL"

  My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
  Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
  Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
  My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Is Antony or we in fault for this?
  Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
  Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
  Let me make answer; thy usurping son.


MMMMCCCVI - "AYSTUPONTHATBL"

  A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
  You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
  Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
  The hum of either army stilly sounds,
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
  Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
  But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
  Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.


MMMMCCCVII - "ESSEDWOODWHOSE"

  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Such are the poor, in health--or else a feast,
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
  We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
  Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
  Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
  How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMMMCCCVIII - "MOTIONSOUNDSWI"

  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
  To do your pleasure and continue friends.
  I am about to weep; but, thinking that
  O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Not any, but abide the change of time,
  Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
  Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
  Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?


MMMMCCCIX - "THTHYSWEETFING"

  They are return'd, my lord, and give it out
  Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
  The day is broke; be wary, look about.
  Have by the very cunning of the scene
  Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
  Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
  Where should they be set else? he were a brave
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  False to my nature? Rather say I play
  I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.


MMMMCCCX - "ERSWHENTHOUGEN"

  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  That swift as quicksilver it courses through
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Or bid me go into a new-made grave
  Upon the country where you make abode;
  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.


MMMMCCCXI - "TLYSWAYSTTHEWI"

  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
  And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
  Your part in her you could not keep from death,
  Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  Who by the hand of France this day hath made
  I had as lief have my mistress a jade.


MMMMCCCXII - "RYCONCORDTHATM"

  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
  Carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  No place will please me so, no mean of death,
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  And violation of all faith and troth
  Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
  Make the young old, the old become a child.


MMMMCCCXIII - "INEEARCONFOUND"

  I will become as liberal as you;
  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  From whence you have them. You are jealous now
  Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
  Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.


MMMMCCCXIV - "SDOIENVYTHOSEJ"

  Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
  Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
  There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.


MMMMCCCXV - "ACKSTHATNIMBLE"

  Art not without ambition, but without
  Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
  That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
  Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMMCCCXVI - "LEAPTOKISSTHET"

  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
  If that she learn not of her eye to look:
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
  The sun will set before I shall discharge
  He hath commanded me to go to bed,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  There was not such a gracious creature born.


MMMMCCCXVII - "ENDERINWARDOFT"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  It were not for your quiet nor your good,
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.
  About it; for it stands me much upon,
  Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
  Disdaining me and throwing favours on
  O good but most unwise patricians! why,
  For going on death's net, whom none resist.
  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!


MMMMCCCXVIII - "HYHANDWHILSTMY"

  How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
  You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
  Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
  Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
  Why should I not now have the like success?
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
  Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.


MMMMCCCXIX - "POORLIPSWHICHS"

  Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  I do protest I never heard of it;
  Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
  Will bless it and approve it with a text,
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
  Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  She is importunate, indeed distract.


MMMMCCCXX - "HOULDTHATHARVE"

  He gave his nose and took't away again;
  Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
  Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
  He craves a parley at your father's house,
  And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
  The hum of either army stilly sounds,
  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  Rather than make unprofited return.
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.


MMMMCCCXXI - "STREAPATTHEWOO"

  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
  Play the recanter, feeling in itself
  And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
  That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
  The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Of all mad matches, never was the like.


MMMMCCCXXII - "DSBOLDNESSBYTH"

  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  Before King Richard in his royal lists?
  Of nature and of nations speak aloud
  Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
  Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Between these woolly breeders in the act,
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
  His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.


MMMMCCCXXIII - "EEBLUSHINGSTAN"

  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Between the promise of his greener days
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
  Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
  And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!


MMMMCCCXXIV - "DTOBESOTICKLED"

  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  That is my office, for my father's sake.
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  Blow me into abhorring! rather make
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
  O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  If he for gold will give us any food;
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
  Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?


MMMMCCCXXV - "THEYWOULDCHANG"

  Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
  How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
  Whereof we have record, trial did draw
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
  Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
  How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
  Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
  No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
  Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?


MMMMCCCXXVI - "ETHEIRSTATEAND"

  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
  He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  She's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
  To note the chamber: I will write all down:
  And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
  There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.


MMMMCCCXXVII - "SITUATIONWITHT"

  So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe
  In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  As the death-bed whereon it must expire
  To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
  Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
  Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
  Into your idle over-handled theme:
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.


MMMMCCCXXVIII - "HOSEDANCINGCHI"

  He does deny him, in respect of his,
  Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
  Strike those that make them; and their story is
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
  Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
  Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
  If none of them have soul in such a kind,
  Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
  God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
  Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
  He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
  If you be king, why should not I succeed?


MMMMCCCXXIX - "PSOERWHOMTHYFI"

  Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Only be patient till we have appeased
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
  Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
  O, God defend me! how am I beset!
  Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
  That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
  Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
  For many years thought dead, are now revived,
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.


MMMMCCCXXX - "NGERSWALKWITHG"

  Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
  Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
  Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
  And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
  Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  With this night's revels and expire the term
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes
  The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
  His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
  Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.


MMMMCCCXXXI - "ENTLEGAITMAKIN"

  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
  The least of you shall share his part thereof.
  Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
  And so I love and honour thee and thine,
  I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
  Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
  And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
  Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
  I was too young that time to value her,
  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.


MMMMCCCXXXII - "GDEADWOODMOREB"

  Go, call before me all the lords in court.
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
  Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
  Whither away, or where is thy abode?
  Other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
  Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  But presently prevent the ways to wail.


MMMMCCCXXXIII - "LESTTHANLIVING"

  Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
  That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
  Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
  And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
  Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  If that from him there may be aught applied
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!


MMMMCCCXXXIV - "LIPSSINCESAUCY"

  Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,
  I am the greatest, able to do least,
  Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
  Such are the poor, in health--or else a feast,
  Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
  I speak amazedly; and it becomes
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
  And not alone in habit and device,
  Using no other weapon but his name.
  Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
  Your right of birth, your empery, your own.


MMMMCCCXXXV - "JACKSSOHAPPYAR"

  Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?
  And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
  Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
  Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
  So much against the mettle of your sex,
  So long as out of limit and true rule
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
  And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
  As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MMMMCCCXXXVI - "EINTHISGIVETHE"

  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
  Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
  I think his understanding is bereft.
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
  If ever he have wife, let her he made
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  The law I bear no malice for my death;
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


MMMMCCCXXXVII - "MTHYFINGERSMET"

  Mars's hot minion is returned again;
  The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
  He fell upon me ere admitted: then
  You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I
  For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
  I speak amazedly; and it becomes
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
  My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  That know the strong'st and surest way to get.


MMMMCCCXXXVIII - "HYLIPSTOKISSTH"

  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  I did present him with the Paris balls.
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
  The many musets through the which he goes
  Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
  So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  That, had he twenty heads to tender down
  Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.


MMMMCCCXXXIX - "EEXPENSEOFSPIR"

  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
 eXcept to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
  She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Or nicely charge your understanding soul
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  Smile with an austere regard of control,--
  Particularities and petty sounds
  Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMMCCCXL - "ITINAWASTEOFSH"

  Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
  This discord's ground, the music would not please.
  I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
  Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
  As much as I can do, I will effect:
  When they change us for others? Is it sport?
  All that may men approve or men detect!
  Son to the queen, after his own report;
  Themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
  Either to get the town again or die:
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
  For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.


MMMMCCCXLI - "AMEISLUSTINACT"

  As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  Even for this let us divided live,
  I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
  To build at all? Much more, in this great work--
  I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  An advocate for an imposter! hush!
  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
  The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?


MMMMCCCXLII - "IONANDTILLACTI"

  I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
  And with the same to act controlling laws.
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Like to a trusty squire did run away:
  Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
  And not be seen to wink of all the day--
  Could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
  The noble duke hath been too much abused.
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.


MMMMCCCXLIII - "ONLUSTISPERJUR"

  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Should in the furthest east begin to draw
  That in the very refuse of thy deeds
  I should report that which I say I saw,
  Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
  Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
  Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMMCCCXLIV - "EDMURDEROUSBLO"

  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Do you not read some tokens of my son
  Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
  Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
  Unmeritable shuns your high request.
  So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
  Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
  Let those who are in favour with their stars
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!


MMMMCCCXLV - "ODYFULLOFBLAME"

  Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
  Did not you tell me I should know the man
  Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
  Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.


MMMMCCCXLVI - "SAVAGEEXTREMER"

  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  As in revenge or quittal of such strife:
  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
 eXpress impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  More than a wild exposture to each chance
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.


MMMMCCCXLVII - "UDECRUELNOTTOT"

  Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
  That virtue must go through. We must not stint
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  To link my dear friend to a common stale.


MMMMCCCXLVIII - "RUSTENJOYDNOSO"

  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Under whose government come they along?
  Speak England first, that hath been forward first
  The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
  Of present dues: the future comes apace:
  Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
  Do the part of an honest man in it.
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


MMMMCCCXLIX - "ONERBUTDESPISE"

  On yon proud man, should take it off again
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
  Did give him that same royalty he wears;
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
  Pinched with the colic, you make faces like
  I shall be well content with any choice
  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMMCCCL - "DSTRAIGHTPASTR"

  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  And much too little of that good I saw
  I know her father, though I know not her;
  Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
  How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
  Then be my deer, since I am such a park;
  Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
  And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
  Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
  That for Achilles' image stood his spear,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


MMMMCCCLI - "EASONHUNTEDAND"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And underneath that consecrated roof,
  Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,
  O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
  Here overcome, as one full of despair,
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
  Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?


MMMMCCCLII - "NOSOONERHADPAS"

  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  One that attends your ladyship's command.
  Or let me die, to look on death no more!
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
  A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
  Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
  Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
  Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?


MMMMCCCLIII - "TREASONHATEDAS"

  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,
  Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
  Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  And lastly, to confirm that amity
  Sticking together in calamity.


MMMMCCCLIV - "ASWALLOWDBAITO"

  Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
  So mighty and so many my defects,
  Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
  And he my husband best of all affects.
  Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,
  Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
  Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
  Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
  Doing the execution and the act
  Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.
  Are of imagination all compact:
  I would have made them skip. I am old now,
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?


MMMMCCCLV - "NPURPOSELAIDTO"

  Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
  Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
  Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
  One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
  She was a charmer, and could almost read
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
  A thievish living on the common road?
  I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!


MMMMCCCLVI - "MAKETHETAKERMA"

  My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
  A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
  Knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
  How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  To hear this of him; and could wish he were
  And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
  Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?


MMMMCCCLVII - "DMADINPURSUITA"

  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  A noble life before a long, and wish
  Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
  In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
  These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?


MMMMCCCLVIII - "NDINPOSSESSION"

  Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
  Did steal behind him as he lay along
  I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Peace be to England, if that war return
  Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
  Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
  She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
  Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
  I shall return before your lordship thence.
  O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.


MMMMCCCLIX - "SOHADHAVINGAND"

  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
  Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
  Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
  Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
  And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
  Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
  Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.


MMMMCCCLX - "INQUESTTOHAVEE"

  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
  Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  So honour cross it from the north to south,
  That I must draw this metal from my side
  Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
  Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMCCCLXI - "XTREMEABLISSIN"

 eXpect your highness' doom of life or death.
  They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
  By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  I came unto your court for honour's cause,
  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.


MMMMCCCLXII - "PROOFANDPROVED"

  Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
  And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
  No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Or if he do, let it at least be said
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Either consent to pay this sum for me
  Do me some service, ere I come to thee.


MMMMCCCLXIII - "AVERYWOEBEFORE"

  As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
  You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
  Which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
  O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  But not without that harmful stroke which since
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  For more assurance that a living prince
  Of your philosophy you make no use,
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMMCCCLXIV - "AJOYPROPOSEDBE"

  As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
  Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
  On late offenders, that he now doth lack
  You may as well do anything most hard,
  Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
  Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
  On bloody courses, the rude scene may end
  Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Doth any name particular belong
  But when in other habits you are seen,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMMCCCLXV - "HINDADREAMALLT"

  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  I see you what you are, you are too proud;
  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
  My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
  Lives in the English court, and is received
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.


MMMMCCCLXVI - "HISTHEWORLDWEL"

  Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
  They be true; if not true, none were enough.
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Live here in heaven and may look on her;
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?


MMMMCCCLXVII - "LKNOWSYETNONEK"

  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  While it doth study to have what it would
  So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
  You are too young, too happy, and too good,
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
  Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.


MMMMCCCLXVIII - "NOWSWELLTOSHUN"

  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
  Were those that went on each side of the queen?
  So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
  Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
  La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense
  The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  Should many people, under two commands,
  Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.


MMMMCCCLXIX - "THEHEAVENTHATL"

  That, by confessing them, the souls of men
  How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  To diet rank minds sick of happiness,
  He never was so womanish; the cause
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!
  Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
  Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.


MMMMCCCLXX - "EADSMENTOTHISH"

  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
  Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
  Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
  Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Nor ask advice of any other thought
  The evil that thou causest to be done,
  Of her or you, having proceeded but
  There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
  Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
  I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  How many years a mortal man may live.


MMMMCCCLXXI - "ELLMYMISTRESSE"

  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
  You cannot witness for me, being slain.
  May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
  I marvel why I answer'd not again;
  Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMMMCCCLXXII - "YESARENOTHINGL"

  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
  Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  O, that record could with a backward look,
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
  Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.


MMMMCCCLXXIII - "IKETHESUNCORAL"

  Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Thy topless deputation he puts on,
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  And this the bleeding business they have done:
  Let me make answer; thy usurping son.


MMMMCCCLXXIV - "ISFARMOREREDTH"

  It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
  And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  Remember since you owed no more to time
  My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
  Hear me with patience but to speak a word.


MMMMCCCLXXV - "ANHERLIPSREDIF"

  A look untender? If't be summer news,
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Led hither by pure love: which of them both
  I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
  Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
  First, let her show her face, and after speak.


MMMMCCCLXXVI - "SNOWBEWHITEWHY"

  Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
  Nature in you stands on the very verge
  Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,
  Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
  He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
  I will become as liberal as you;
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Within the eye of honour, be assured,
  His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.


MMMMCCCLXXVII - "THENHERBREASTS"

  Then were it certain you were not so bad
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  All that are his so too. To do this deed,
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  The very tyranny and rage of his.
  Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.


MMMMCCCLXXVIII - "AREDUNIFHAIRSB"

  Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man,
  Is not inured; return again in haste;
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
  If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?


MMMMCCCLXXIX - "EWIRESBLACKWIR"

  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Will take again your queen as yours at first,
  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
  Before King Richard in his royal lists?
  Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.
  And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
  Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
  King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
  When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
  I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMMCCCLXXX - "ESGROWONHERHEA"

  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
  Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
  One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.


MMMMCCCLXXXI - "DIHAVESEENROSE"

  Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
  His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;
  And useth it to patronage his theft.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
  Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMMMCCCLXXXII - "SDAMASKDREDAND"

  Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
  Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
  As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
  Say to her, we have measured many miles
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
  Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
  And we will fear no poison, which attends
  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
  Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?


MMMMCCCLXXXIII - "WHITEBUTNOSUCH"

  When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
  Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  But I attest the gods, your full consent
  Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
  Though then, God knows, I had no such intent
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.


MMMMCCCLXXXIV - "ROSESSEEIINHER"

  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
  Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MMMMCCCLXXXV - "CHEEKSANDINSOM"

  Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
  Have in these parts from morn till even fought
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  King Richard might create a perfect guess
  Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
  And all the honours that can fly from us
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  If for my love, as there is no such cause,
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
  Myself am one made privy to the plot.


MMMMCCCLXXXVI - "EPERFUMESISTHE"

  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Put but a little water in a spoon,
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  From whom my absence was not six months old
  Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
  Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
  Is death to any he that utters them.
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Then think you right: I am not what I am.
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.


MMMMCCCLXXXVII - "REMOREDELIGHTT"

  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
  I rather of his absence make this use:
  Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  To death, or to a vow of single life.
  To separate the husband and the wife.


MMMMCCCLXXXVIII - "HANINTHEBREATH"

  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,
  That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  But nothing can affection's course control,
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  And so they are: alas, that they are so;
  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
  He speaks not like a man of God's making.


MMMMCCCLXXXIX - "THATFROMMYMIST"

  The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
  There is no day for me to look upon;
  For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  My absence doth neglect no great designs,
  I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
  Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
  To cloak offences with a cunning brow.


MMMMCCCXC - "RESSREEKSILOVE"

  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Save that there was not time enough to hear,
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
  Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMMCCCXCI - "TOHEARHERSPEAK"

  Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;
  Of all his wars within the realm of France?
  Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
  Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?


MMMMCCCXCII - "YETWELLIKNOWTH"

  Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
  With other princes that may best be spared,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
  Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
  I do not without danger walk these streets:
  Knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
  What things again most dear in the esteem
  That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
  Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.


MMMMCCCXCIII - "ATMUSICHATHAFA"

  A beast, to bear every knave's wrong.
  The king is kind; and well we know the king
  Methinks I should not thus be led along,
  Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
  Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
  Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
  Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
  Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  How quickly nature falls into revolt
  And now at length they overflow their banks.
  For daring to affy a mighty lord
  And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.


MMMMCCCXCIV - "RMOREPLEASINGS"

  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
  O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  And that the legions now in Gallia are
  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
  If he improve them, may well stretch so far
  Not measuring what use we made of them.
  Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
  So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.


MMMMCCCXCV - "OUNDIGRANTINEV"

  O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
  Until you see her die again; for then
  No more than my residing here at Rome
  Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
  None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
  No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MMMMCCCXCVI - "ERSAWAGODDESSG"

  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
  With some few private friends upon this coast.
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
  Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Some offer me commodities to buy:
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.


MMMMCCCXCVII - "OMYMISTRESSWHE"

  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
  Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
  The greatest strength and power he can make,
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
  What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
  He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMMCCCXCVIII - "NSHEWALKSTREAD"

  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
  And he would love me dearly as his child.
  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  An't please your grace, the two great cardinals
  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?


MMMMCCCXCIX - "SONTHEGROUNDAN"

  Such terrible impression made the dream.
  O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
  Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
  Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
  As a decrepit father takes delight
  Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.


MMMMCD - "DYETBYHEAVENIT"

  Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Not working with the eye without the ear,
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.


MMMMCDI - "HINKMYLOVEASRA"

  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  I have it ready for thee; here it is.
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
  Or overthrow incurable ensues.
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  A son of mine, which long I have not seen.


MMMMCDII - "REASANYSHEBELI"

  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
  Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
  Ask me what question thou canst possible,
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  You judge it straight a thing impossible
  Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  But Dover castle: London hath received,
  Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
  Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
  I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!


MMMMCDIII - "EDWITHFALSECOM"

  Either of king or council, when you went
  Do not desire to see this letter.
  We'll light upon some settled low content.
  I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
  The interruption of their churlish drums
  He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
  Fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
  A world of torments though I should endure,
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
  My lord, where are you? what devise you on?


MMMMCDIV - "PARETHOUARTAST"

  Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
  A most extracting frenzy of mine own
  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  And nothing can or shall content my soul
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  There is no malice in this burning coal;
  And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
  Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
  To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!


MMMMCDV - "YRANNOUSSOASTH"

  You are too much mistaken in this king:
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
  Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
  Or else I will discover nought to thee.
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  So many English kings. Thy due from me
  There's something in me that reproves my fault;
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?


MMMMCDVI - "OUARTASTHOSEWH"

  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  The letter is too long by half a mile.
  And many strokes, though with a little axe,
  Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
  To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
  So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?


MMMMCDVII - "OSEBEAUTIESPRO"

  O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  And sung by children in succeeding times.
  Usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
  These accusations and these grievous crimes
  I should rejoice now at this happy news;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!


MMMMCDVIII - "UDLYMAKETHEMCR"

  Undoing all, as all had never been!
  Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
  Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
  Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


MMMMCDIX - "UELFORWELLTHOU"

  Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Love loving not itself none other can.
  Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
  Of my word, I have written to effect;
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.


MMMMCDX - "KNOWSTTOMYDEAR"

  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
  With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
  Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
  Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
  The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;
  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
  You are too young, too happy, and too good,
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MMMMCDXI - "DOTINGHEARTTHO"

  Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
  Takes on the point of honour to support
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!


MMMMCDXII - "UARTTHEFAIREST"

  Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
  Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
  He should have had a volume of farewells;
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
  All that good time will give us: this attempt
  It is my lady, O, it is my love!
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
  That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.


MMMMCDXIII - "ANDMOSTPRECIOU"

  As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
  Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  My father stays my coming; answer not;
  O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
  Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
  This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;
  Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
  It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
  Of his bright passage to the occident.
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.


MMMMCDXIV - "SJEWELYETINGOO"

  Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
  Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
  Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  I would not care, I then would be content,
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Give me some ink and paper in my tent
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MMMMCDXV - "DFAITHSOMESAYT"

  Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
  Found that the issue was not his begot;
  And, if you may confess it, say withal,
  I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
  That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
  Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
  Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
  You love my son; invention is ashamed,
  That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!


MMMMCDXVI - "HATTHEEBEHOLDT"

  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
  The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
  How high a pitch his resolution soars!
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  By this, I think, the dial points at five:
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
  Only to show his pomp as well in France
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
  That proof is call'd impossibility.


MMMMCDXVII - "HYFACEHATHNOTT"

  Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
  You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
  From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
  And the nobility of Rome are his:
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
  Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  The holy suit which fain it would convince,
  To crown himself king and suppress the prince.


MMMMCDXVIII - "HEPOWERTOMAKEL"

  He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
  Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  Ready to go, but never to return.
  Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
  O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
  Making another head to fight again.
  According to the statute of the town,
  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.


MMMMCDXIX - "OVEGROANTOSAYT"

  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Or that or any place that harbours men.
  As shaming any eye should thee behold,
  Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
  Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  Yet nature might have made me as these are,
  That brought her for this high good turn so far?


MMMMCDXX - "HEYERRIDARENOT"

  Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Now fear I this will give it start again;
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  Threshold till my lord return from the wars.


MMMMCDXXI - "BESOBOLDALTHOU"

  Be patient, Princes; you do know these fits
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
  Did lately meet in the intestine shock
  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
  Have of their puissance made a little taste.
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.


MMMMCDXXII - "GHISWEARITTOMY"

  Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
  He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
  If any such be here--as God forbid!--
  Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
  Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
  Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
  The dearer by I know how much an ounce.
  Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.


MMMMCDXXIII - "SELFALONEANDTO"

  Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And his achievements of no less account:
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
  To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
  Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?


MMMMCDXXIV - "BESURETHATISNO"

  By their increase, now knows not which is which:
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  To trip the course of law, and blunt the sword
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
  The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
  Our melancholy upon your head!


MMMMCDXXV - "TFALSEISWEARAT"

  The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!
  For beauty starved with her severity
  And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
  Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
  Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;
  To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.


MMMMCDXXVI - "HOUSANDGROANSB"

  Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
  Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
  All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
  Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
  Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
  Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
  Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
  As are companions noted and most known
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
  But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.


MMMMCDXXVII - "UTTHINKINGONTH"

  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
  The need we have to use you did provoke
  Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
  I will take order for her keeping close.
  No harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
  Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
  Give him allowance for the better man;
  O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  There's something in me that reproves my fault;
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?


MMMMCDXXVIII - "YFACEONEONANOT"

  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
  A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
  Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
  Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
  One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
  To come abroad with him at his request.


MMMMCDXXIX - "HERSNECKDOWITN"

  Here overcome, as one full of despair,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
  Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
  No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
  Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
  Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  When I to feast expressly am forbid;
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
  Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.


MMMMCDXXX - "ESSBEARTHYBLAC"

  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
  But not without that harmful stroke which since
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  And egally indeed to all estates,--
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  You may as well do anything most hard,
  But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
  Can sick men play so nicely with their names?


MMMMCDXXXI - "KISFAIRESTINMY"

  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
  So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
  For making him egregiously an ass
  And charge that no man should disturb your rest
  I am not here against your father's peace;
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
  That, were my state far worser than it is,
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
  Yet none of you would once plead for his life.


MMMMCDXXXII - "JUDGMENTSPLACE"

  Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
  Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
  Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
  Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
  Met us again and madly bent on us,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  That shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
  Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
  And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMMCDXXXIII - "INNOTHINGARTTH"

  If with too credent ear you list his songs,
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
  His days may finish ere that hapless time.
  Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
  And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.


MMMMCDXXXIV - "OUBLACKSAVEINT"

  Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
  Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
  Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
  Always a villain's office or a fool's.
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!


MMMMCDXXXV - "HYDEEDSANDTHEN"

  Heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
  Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
  Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
  Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.


MMMMCDXXXVI - "CETHISSLANDERA"

  Coming to look on you, thinking you dead-
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
  Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  Accountant to the law upon that pain.


MMMMCDXXXVII - "SITHINKPROCEED"

  Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
  If I would time expend with such a snipe.
  That labour may you save: see where he comes.
  His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
  I do assure thee, father, so it is.
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!


MMMMCDXXXVIII - "STHINEEYESILOV"

  Souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
  There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  If there be nothing new, but that which is
  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MMMMCDXXXIX - "EANDTHEYASPITY"

  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
  Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
  Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
  Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
  And so success of mischief shall be born,
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
  I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
  This star of England: Fortune made his sword;
  You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.


MMMMCDXL - "INGMEKNOWINGTH"

  I was preserved to serve this noble count.
  Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
  Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
  If that the devil and mischance look big
  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
  Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
  Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.


MMMMCDXLI - "YHEARTTORMENTS"

  Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
  He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  And almost thence my nature is subdued
  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
  So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.


MMMMCDXLII - "MEWITHDISDAINH"

  My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
  He bow'd his nature, never known before
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
  Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
  Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
  If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
  Have done, for more I hardly can endure.


MMMMCDXLIII - "AVEPUTONBLACKA"

  All these are servants to deceitful men.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
  That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  But now the arbitrator of despairs,
  Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
  And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
  Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  As those that I am come to tell you of!


MMMMCDXLIV - "NDLOVINGMOURNE"

  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  I took a costly jewel from my neck,
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
  O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.


MMMMCDXLV - "RSBELOOKINGWIT"

  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  Or in the night, imagining some fear,
  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
  If to come hither you have measured miles,
  Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
  Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
  With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.


MMMMCDXLVI - "HPRETTYRUTHUPO"

  Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
  Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,
  This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
  You know no more than others; but you frame
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
  The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Propinquity and property of blood,
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?


MMMMCDXLVII - "NMYPAINANDTRUL"

  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
  I will not stay to-night for all the town;
  Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
  Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
  Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
  Dear general, I never gave you cause.
  That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Upon my head and all this famous land.
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.


MMMMCDXLVIII - "YNOTTHEMORNING"

  You may as well forbid the mountain pines
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  That none so small advantage shall step forth
  That can torment him much and hold him long,
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
  Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
  I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.


MMMMCDXLIX - "SUNOFHEAVENBET"

  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Unto the rigour of severest law.
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
  Have faculty by nature to subsist;
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  That ever yet this land was guilty of.


MMMMCDL - "TERBECOMESTHEG"

  That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  But at this instant he is sick my lord,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
  Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
  Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!


MMMMCDLI - "REYCHEEKSOFTHE"

  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
  Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
  He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
  O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
  To try if thou be current gold indeed
  How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MMMMCDLII - "EASTNORTHATFUL"

  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  And make a sop of all this solid globe:
  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
  The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
  His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
  As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
  Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
  Upon whose age we void it up again,
  Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.


MMMMCDLIII - "LSTARTHATUSHER"

  Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
  So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
  That presses them and learns them first to bear,
  Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
  Real necessities, and give way the while
  That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
  He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
  Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:
  Upon his visage, and that all the walls
  Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.


MMMMCDLIV - "SINTHEEVENDOTH"

  Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
  It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
  Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  That they who brought me in my master's hate
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Nor I nor any man that but man is
  Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.
  His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.


MMMMCDLV - "HALFTHATGLORYT"

  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
  Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
  For these known evils, but to give me leave,
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  And that unaptness made your minister,
  There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
  Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Receiving nought by elements so slow
  York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;
  Than I by letters shall direct your course.


MMMMCDLVI - "OTHESOBERWESTA"

  O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
  Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
  Only attended by Nerissa here,
  But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
  That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
  And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!


MMMMCDLVII - "STHOSETWOMOURN"

  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
  She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  The more I hate, the more he follows me.
  Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
  Or bid me go into a new-made grave
  My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.


MMMMCDLVIII - "INGEYESBECOMET"

  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
  Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
  But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  CORIOLANUS,
  Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
  My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.


MMMMCDLIX - "HYFACEOLETITTH"

  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  Yet would my love to thee be still as much;
  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
  And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
  CORIOLANUS,
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  To free us from his father's wrathful curse,
  In the division of each several crime,
  The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  The greatest strength and power he can make,
  Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.


MMMMCDLX - "ENASWELLBESEEM"

  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  No better than the earth he lies upon,
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  She is a woman, therefore to be won.
  When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
  Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  My lord, your loving nephew now is come.


MMMMCDLXI - "THYHEARTTOMOUR"

  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
  How I may bear me here: my prime request,
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.


MMMMCDLXII - "NFORMESINCEMOU"

  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  May all the building in my fancy pluck
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
  CORIOLANUS!
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.


MMMMCDLXIII - "RNINGDOTHTHEEG"

  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  If consequence do but approve my dream,
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
  Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
  O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Grows elder now and cares it be not done.


MMMMCDLXIV - "RACEANDSUITTHY"

  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  And will not let me welcome this good news.
  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
  Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
  Upon the country where you make abode;
  I know not what to do: I would to God,
  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
  The third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.


MMMMCDLXV - "PITYLIKEINEVER"

  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
  If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
  That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
  Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
  Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.
  It could not else be, I should prove so base,
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
  Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MMMMCDLXVI - "YPARTTHENWILLI"

  Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
  Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
  And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  The tidings come that they are all arrived.
  They sale of offices and towns in France,
  He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
  Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
  Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
  I fear it is too choleric a meat.


MMMMCDLXVII - "SWEARBEAUTYHER"

  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  Who will not change a raven for a dove?
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  And make me happy in your unity.
  Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
  Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
  You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
  He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


MMMMCDLXVIII - "SELFISBLACKAND"

  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
  For, as I think, they do command him home,
  It is extempore, from my mother wit.
  Show duty, as mistaken all this while
  By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
  Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
  And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
  Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
  King John, your king and England's doth approach,
  And nothing marted with him. If your lass
  Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.


MMMMCDLXIX - "ALLTHEYFOULTHA"

  Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
  Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
  From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  Then after to her father will I break;
  Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
  And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.


MMMMCDLXX - "TTHYCOMPLEXION"

  To my demands. Why do you pity me?
  The anger of the king nor guilty of,
  Have put on black and loving mourners be,
  Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
  Could force his soul so to his own conceit
  O, let me teach you how to knit again
  Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
  Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
 eXceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.


MMMMCDLXXI - "LACKBESHREWTHA"

  Lesser his person than an ill report;
  And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
  Came from the north and thus it did import:
  Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
  But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
  Recking as little what betideth me
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Were to prove false, which I will never be,
  That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
  His eye-balls further out than when he lived,
  And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.


MMMMCDLXXII - "THEARTTHATMAKE"

  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  He was a gentleman on whom I built
  Expire before the flowers in their caps,
  And give to dust that is a little gilt
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
  Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
  How heavy do I journey on the way,
  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
  More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
  And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
  Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMMMCDLXXIII - "SMYHEARTTOGROA"

  Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
  May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
  You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
  His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  The fearful difference of incensed kings:
  To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  And lace itself with his society?


MMMMCDLXXIV - "NFORTHATDEEPWO"

  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  For on the grass she lies as she were slain,
  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  The hum of either army stilly sounds,
  Here is my hand; the premises observed,
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  That I some lady trifles have reserved,
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Presence majestical would put him out,
  What then became of them I cannot tell
  Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!


MMMMCDLXXV - "UNDITGIVESMYFR"

  Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  During whose reign the Percies of the north,
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  She bids me think how I have been forsworn
  May you a better feast never behold,
  Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
  Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MMMMCDLXXVI - "IENDANDMEISTNO"

  In at his window; set this up with wax
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
  Disgracing of these colours that I wear
  My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Sith priest and holy water are so near
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!


MMMMCDLXXVII - "TENOUGHTOTORTU"

  The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
  Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
  The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
  On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
  Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.


MMMMCDLXXVIII - "REMEALONEBUTSL"

  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Must murder wives much better than themselves
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
  Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
  Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
  Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  But when in other habits you are seen,
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  Such is the lightness of you common men.
  Let's call more help to have them bound again.


MMMMCDLXXIX - "AVETOSLAVERYMY"

  As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
  O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
  Yet once again, to make us public sport,
  Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
  Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.


MMMMCDLXXX - "SWEETSTFRIENDM"

  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  Women nearest; but men, men are the things
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
  So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
  The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
  From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  My love shall hear the music of my hounds.


MMMMCDLXXXI - "USTBEMEFROMMYS"

  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
  Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
  My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
  She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.


MMMMCDLXXXII - "ELFTHYCRUELEYE"

  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
  The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
  Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
  Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
  Either of you to be the other's end.


MMMMCDLXXXIII - "HATHTAKENANDMY"

  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
  And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
  And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
  Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.


MMMMCDLXXXIV - "NEXTSELFTHOUHA"

  No; let my father seek another heir.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
 eXceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  First to my God and next unto your grace.
  That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
  Haply a woman's voice may do some good,
  Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  Him: if you would not, it were a good sign
  Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.


MMMMCDLXXXV - "RDERHASTENGROS"

  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  And often at his very loose decides
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  The current that with gentle murmur glides,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Nay, he must bear you company. The king
  Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!


MMMMCDLXXXVI - "SDOFHIMMYSELFA"

  Strange images of death. As thick as hail
  Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  For such proceeding I am charged withal,
  He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,
  If there be rule in unity itself,
  Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
  More free from motion, no, not Death himself
  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now
  And then pursue me as you draw your bow.


MMMMCDLXXXVII - "NDTHEEIAMFORSA"

  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
  How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
  Although I think 'twas in another sense-
  Matter against me; and his eye reviled
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  She melted into air. Affrighted much,
  And know the office that belongs to such.


MMMMCDLXXXVIII - "KENATORMENTTHR"

  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
  And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
  This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus;
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  More health and happiness betide my liege
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Never to England shall he bear his life;
  Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
  That he is too familiar with his wife.
  Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


MMMMCDLXXXIX - "ICETHREEFOLDTH"

  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.


MMMMCDXC - "USTOBECROSSDPR"

  Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
  One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!


MMMMCDXCI - "ISONMYHEARTINT"

  I hope the king made peace with all of us
  Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
  On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
  Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
  Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
  Rain added to a river that is rank
  The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
  Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.


MMMMCDXCII - "HYSTEELBOSOMSW"

  How can they then assist me in the act?
  Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
  But did you not request to have it cut?
  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
  Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
  My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.


MMMMCDXCIII - "ARDBUTTHENMYFR"

  About the wood go swifter than the wind,
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
  Upon the water as he'll stand and read
  That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
  That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
  Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
  For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.


MMMMCDXCIV - "IENDSHEARTLETM"

  In his own conduct, purposely to take
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  Safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
  His subjects to oppression and contempt
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  All that good time will give us: this attempt
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.


MMMMCDXCV - "YPOORHEARTBAIL"

  You do impeach your modesty too much,
  Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
  O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Her father is no better than an earl,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
  Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
  After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
  If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
  Let's step into the shadow of these trees.


MMMMCDXCVI - "WHOEERKEEPSMEL"

  Which was the model of that Danish seal;
  Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
  Of all treasons, we still see them reveal
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.


MMMMCDXCVII - "ETMYHEARTBEHIS"

  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
  Myself of many I am charged withal:
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
  Revenue, execution of the rest,
  The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
  But longer did we not retain much hope;
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
  It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
  Since the physician at your father's died?


MMMMCDXCVIII - "GUARDTHOUCANST"

  Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  And they have served me to effectless use:
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Do the low-rated English play at dice;
  Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
  Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
  Or God will punish me. I do believe,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
  And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
  Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.


MMMMCDXCIX - "NOTTHENUSERIGO"

  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Of this most fair occasion, by the which
  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
  He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
  Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
  Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
  Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
  Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
  I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
  Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
  O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!


MMMMD - "RINMYGAOLANDYE"

  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
  Your brother and his lover have embraced:
  Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
  And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
  A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
  Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


MMMMDI - "TTHOUWILTFORIB"

  That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;
  The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
  He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen
  Is all the policy, strength and defence,
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  That had a royal lover, took his hint;
  For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
  O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?


MMMMDII - "EINGPENTINTHEE"

  Either of you to be the other's end.
  I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
  No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
  God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Now am I like that proud insulting ship
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  England is safe, if true within itself?


MMMMDIII - "PERFORCEAMTHIN"

  Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
  Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
  O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And bloody England into England gone,
  Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  I will make haste: but, till I come again,
  No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.


MMMMDIV - "EANDALLTHATISI"

  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
  And when a woman woos, what woman's son
  Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
  Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
  That time of year thou mayst in me behold
  He may surrender; so we shall proceed
  As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
  That he may never more false title plead,
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
  It shall not need; thy father hath his life.


MMMMDV - "NMESONOWIHAVEC"

  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
  O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
  What three things does drink especially provoke?
  I speak no more than what my soul intends;
  How that ambitious Constance would not cease
  And, in the hearing of these many friends,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.


MMMMDVI - "ONFESSDTHATHEI"

  O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
  So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
  Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
  That of thy death and business I can tell.
  Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:
  And what love can do that dares love attempt;
  That I should seem to lack humanity
  He did solicit you in free contempt
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  I hope this reason stands for my excuse.


MMMMDVII - "STHINEANDIMYSE"

  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  The very tyranny and rage of his.
  He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
  I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Despoiled of your honour in your life,
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
  More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMMDVIII - "LFAMMORTGAGEDT"

  Late did he shine upon the English side;
  For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
  And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
  Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
  May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
  Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
  Rather to wonder at the things you hear
  This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
  Good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
  And little look'd for at your helping hands.
  Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.


MMMMDIX - "OTHYWILLMYSELF"

  O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
  To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
  How might a prince of my great hopes forget
  Yourself again after yourself's decease,
  Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
  Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
  Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
  For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.


MMMMDX - "ILLFORFEITSOTH"

  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Let not my sister read it in your eye;
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
  For in this sin he is as deep as I.
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
  That faith would live again by death of need.
  Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
  O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  To have their unseen sin remain untold;
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


MMMMDXI - "ATOTHERMINETHO"

  A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
  The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
  On his head, bearing a long white wand, as
  Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
  Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  My love admits no qualifying dross;
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!


MMMMDXII - "UWILTRESTORETO"

  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  Which I so lively acted with my tears
  I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
  Like softest music to attending ears!
  The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.
  Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
  To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
  Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!


MMMMDXIII - "BEMYCOMFORTSTI"

  Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
  Making not reservation of yourselves,
  Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
  O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
  To nature none more bound; his training such,
  Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
  Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.


MMMMDXIV - "LLBUTTHOUWILTN"

  Let them obey that know not how to rule;
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
  Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;
  The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  Without much shame retold or spoken of.
  Is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
  Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
  They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.


MMMMDXV - "OTNORHEWILLNOT"

  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
  To help King Edward in his time of storm,
  No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  We are alone; here's none but thee and I.
  If he be credulous and trust my tale,
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
  Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
  That nice-preserved honesty of yours.


MMMMDXVI - "BEFREEFORTHOUA"

  By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  For any benefit that points to me,
  Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  That he believes himself: so do not I.
  How like a winter hath my absence been
  O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  As this their jangling I esteem a sport.


MMMMDXVII - "RTCOVETOUSANDH"

  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
  Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
  Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
  Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,
  Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
  Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
  Such commendations as becomes a maid,
  And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
  Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
  Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
  Have done, for more I hardly can endure.


MMMMDXVIII - "EISKINDHELEARN"

  Else would he never so demean himself.
  If this be error and upon me proved,
  Since I am crept in favour with myself,
  Know you how much the people may be moved
  I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  Her father hath commanded her to slip
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
  Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
  Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.


MMMMDXIX - "DBUTSURETYLIKE"

  Do more than counterpoise a full third part
  But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
  Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
  To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
  Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
  Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
  Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMMDXX - "TOWRITEFORMEUN"

  To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Who was the first of Britain which did put
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  For I have served him, and the man commands
  Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Uncouple here and let us make a bay
  Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?


MMMMDXXI - "DERTHATBONDTHA"

  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  To whom I will retail my conquest won,
  Her reason to herself is only known,
  And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
  Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.
  By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
  Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
  Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
  Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?


MMMMDXXII - "THIMASFASTDOTH"

  To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
  If consequence do but approve my dream,
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
  Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
  And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
  Thou dost make possible things not so held,
  How many of you have mine eyes beheld!


MMMMDXXIII - "BINDTHESTATUTE"

  Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
  If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
  And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
  The second name of men, obeys his points
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  There is enough written upon this earth
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMMMDXXIV - "OFTHYBEAUTYTHO"

  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
  Being mechanical, you ought not walk
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  As strange unto your town as to your talk;
  Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
  To no apparent likelihood of breach,
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  Than I am able to instruct or teach:
  Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.


MMMMDXXV - "UWILTTAKETHOUU"

  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  With words that in an honest suit might move.
  I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
  Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
  To know, when two authorities are up,
  That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
  Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
  Under a cloak that is of any length.


MMMMDXXVI - "SURERTHATPUTST"

  She is my essence, and I leave to be,
  Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
  Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  The little birds that tune their morning's joy
  He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
  Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
  The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
  Particularities and petty sounds
  Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
  The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
  Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
  There should be found such false dissembling guile?


MMMMDXXVII - "FORTHALLTOUSEA"

  For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
  Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  Upon so soft a subject as myself!
  Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  And thou art wedded to calamity.


MMMMDXXVIII - "NDSUEAFRIENDCA"

  No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
  From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  In things of great receipt with ease we prove
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
  And plague injustice with the pains of hell.


MMMMDXXIX - "MEDEBTORFORMYS"

  My title's good, and better far than his.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Being once perfected how to grant suits,
  Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
  Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.


MMMMDXXX - "AKESOHIMILOSET"

  As having sense of beauty, do omit
  Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
  Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
  I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
  My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
  I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
  Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.
  Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  That put Armado's page out of his part!


MMMMDXXXI - "HROUGHMYUNKIND"

  How much in duty I am bound to both.
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
  Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
  If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
  Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.


MMMMDXXXII - "ABUSEHIMHAVEIL"

  Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
  But your discretions better can persuade
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  How with mine honour may I give him that
  It shall appear that your demands are just,
  Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
  How many days will finish up the year;
  And by a part of all thy glory live.
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.


MMMMDXXXIII - "OSTTHOUHASTBOT"

  One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Upon my death the French can little boast;
  Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
  A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
  Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
  The weary sun hath made a golden set,
  But in this changing what is your intent?
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  The better that your lordship please to ask.


MMMMDXXXIV - "HHIMANDMEHEPAY"

  Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
  Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
  If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
  More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
  And know us by these colours for thy foes,
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  Deny your asking: take your choice of those
  Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Having so swift and excellent a wit
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
  An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.


MMMMDXXXV - "STHEWHOLEANDYE"

  Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
  Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
  Let me have open means to come to them,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  And, to add greater honours to his age
  Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMMDXXXVI - "TAMINOTFREEWHO"

  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
  More honourable state, more courtship lives
  I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.
  Neither of either; I remit both twain.
  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
  Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
  France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
  He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
  O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!


MMMMDXXXVII - "EVERHATHHERWIS"

  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
  Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  How often said, my dignity would last
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  When all the breathers of this world are dead;
  It is the humane way: the other course
  Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.


MMMMDXXXVIII - "HTHOUHASTTHYWI"

  Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  His mother was a witch, and one so strong
  O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
  Upon remainder of a dear account,
  He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
  The love of him, and this respect besides,
  The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.


MMMMDXXXIX - "LLANDWILLTOBOO"

  Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Am I a queen in title and in style,
  Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
  Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
  With reservation of an hundred knights,
  I know you would be prouder of the work
  Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
  Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
  This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
  Out of the path which shall directly lead
  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.


MMMMDXL - "TANDWILLINOVER"

  To quicken your increase, I will beget
  And cloister thee in some religious house:
  Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
  Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
  Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
  O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MMMMDXLI - "PLUSMORETHANEN"

  Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
  Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  So then two bosoms and a single troth.
  Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
  Of all mad matches, never was the like.
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  He holds your temper in a high respect
  A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.


MMMMDXLII - "OUGHAMITHATVEX"

  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
  Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
  I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
  And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
  That none but I and my companion maid
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  Exist, and be a member of his love
 eXceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMMDXLIII - "THEESTILLTOTHY"

  That treason can but peep to what it would,
  Having been well, that would have made me sick,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
  To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
  Into her womb convey sterility;
  Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
  Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
  Turning past evils to advantages.
  Or made them swear against the thing they see;
  To match with her that brings no vantages.
  How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
  You love the breeder better than the male.


MMMMDXLIV - "SWEETWILLMAKIN"

  She is a theme of honour and renown,
  Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,
  I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
  Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
  Let that one article rank with the rest;
  Methinks I should not thus be led along,
  And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.


MMMMDXLV - "GADDITIONTHUSW"

  Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
  And say you do't by our permission;
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Darest with thy frozen admonition
  Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
  That you should have an inch of any ground
  I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
  Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.


MMMMDXLVI - "ILTTHOUWHOSEWI"

  I would be friends with you and have your love,
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  That you to-day promised to tell me of?
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  He apprehends a world of figures here,
  O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set
  How can I then return in happy plight,
  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
  So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  What of his heart perceive you in his face
  I would prefer him to a better place!


MMMMDXLVII - "LLISLARGEANDSP"

  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Levy great sums of money through the realm
  I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
  Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
  Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
  Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
  And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
  Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
  Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
  Prince John, your son, doth kiss your Grace's hand.


MMMMDXLVIII - "ACIOUSNOTONCEV"

  Arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
  Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
  I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Under the tide: but now I breathe again
  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
  O, she was nought; and long of her it was
  Too little payment for so great a debt.
  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
  Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMMMDXLIX - "OUCHSAFETOHIDE"

  O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
  Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
  Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
  Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  And therefore take this compact of a truce,
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
  Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMMDL - "MYWILLINTHINES"

  More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
  Your master will be dead ere you return;
  What he will do: but if he will not yield,
  I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
  La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense
  Like goodly buildings left without a roof
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
  To save me from the danger that might come
  He calls me to a restitution large
  Impostors to true fear, would well become
  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!


MMMMDLI - "HALLWILLINOTHE"

  Have you perused the letters from the pope,
  As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
  Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
  Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
  Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
  Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;
  Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
  Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.


MMMMDLII - "RSSEEMRIGHTGRA"

  Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
  Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
  Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Made to run even upon even ground,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
  This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Against the pope and count his friends my foes.


MMMMDLIII - "CIOUSANDINMYWI"

  Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
  It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
  O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Shall more attend upon the coming space,
  And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
  Not his that spoils her young before her face.
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
  Where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
  I will be even with thee, doubt it not.


MMMMDLIV - "LLNOFAIRACCEPT"

  Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
  Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
  Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
  Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
  For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
  Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
  I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  And for his ordinary pays his heart
  Cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
  There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.


MMMMDLV - "ANCESHINETHESE"

  As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
  Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
  Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Save, where you are how happy you make those.
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
  Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Till after many accents and delays,
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.


MMMMDLVI - "AALLWATERYETRE"

  A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
  A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
  Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
  As that is desperate which we would prevent.
  These people saw the chain about his neck.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Your lord and master did well to make his
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
  Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMMMDLVII - "CEIVESRAINSTIL"

  Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  And his disciples only envy at,
  If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.


MMMMDLVIII - "LANDINABUNDANC"

  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
  Is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  And give some evening music to her ear.
  But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
  Upon the head of valour; which indeed
  Not any, but abide the change of time,
  Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
  And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?


MMMMDLIX - "EADDETHTOHISST"

  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Delivered up again with peaceful words?
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  To take the basest and most poorest shape
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  The bloody proclamation to escape
  Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
  He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
  In having much, torments us with defect
  Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
  Say that you love me not; but say not so
  That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.


MMMMDLX - "ORESOTHOUBEING"

  Open as day for melting charity;
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
  O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
  Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
  Between whose endless jar justice resides,
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  If I know this, know all the world besides,
  Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
  Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.


MMMMDLXI - "RICHINWILLADDT"

  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Within the guilty closure of thy walls
  I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
  Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
  Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
  As strange unto your town as to your talk;
  Drew to defend him when he was beset:
  Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
  That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.


MMMMDLXII - "OTHYWILLONEWIL"

  Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
  You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
  We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
  It must be great that can inherit us
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
  Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  Which here we came to spout against your town,
  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
  Leaving thee living in posterity?


MMMMDLXIII - "LOFMINETOMAKET"

  Lest that it make me so unsound a man
  Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
  Fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
  My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
  I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
  And made an evening at the noontide prick.
  Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  To blush and beautify the cheek again.


MMMMDLXIV - "HYLARGEWILLMOR"

  Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
  Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
  Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;
  And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  Whose nature is so far from doing harms
  In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.


MMMMDLXV - "ELETNOUNKINDNO"

  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  To lesson me and tell me some good mean
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Of all the gentry; for the most part such
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
  If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
  Other men fitter to go out than I.


MMMMDLXVI - "FAIRBESEECHERS"

  For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
  An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  Indeed we heard how near his death he was
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Shall I return this answer to the king?


MMMMDLXVII - "KILLTHINKALLBU"

  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
  Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
  I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
  And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
  Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
  Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
  Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.


MMMMDLXVIII - "TONEANDMEINTHA"

  This was the most unkindest cut of all;
  Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  And with the vantage of mine own excuse
  Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  I know her father, though I know not her;
  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
  Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
  How I came by the crown, O God, forgive;
  And grant it may with thee in true peace live!


MMMMDLXIX - "TONEWILLIFTHYS"

  To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
  I will requite you with as good a thing;
  Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
  Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
  I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
  For such things in a false disloyal knave
  The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
  Sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?


MMMMDLXX - "OULCHEQUETHEET"

  O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  That will forsake thee and go home in peace.


MMMMDLXXI - "HATICOMESONEAR"

  Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
  And question this most bloody piece of work,
  Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
  In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
  Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
  O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
  Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
  Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!


MMMMDLXXII - "SWEARTOTHYBLIN"

  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Which if we find outweighs ability,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And such high vaunts of his nobility,
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  The next news is, I have to London sent
  O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  To punish them; although not done, but meant.
  His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
  You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
  Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
  Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
  In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?


MMMMDLXXIII - "DSOULTHATIWAST"

  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
  That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,
  How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
  And from his bosom purge this black despair!
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
  Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
  Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
  Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
  Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.


MMMMDLXXIV - "HYWILLANDWILLT"

  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  Your exposition on the holy text
  Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
  Impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Losing both beauty and utility.
  Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
  And such high vaunts of his nobility,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Discredit more in hiding of the fault
  With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
  Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.


MMMMDLXXV - "HYSOULKNOWSISA"

  His folly to the mettle of my speech?
  You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
  Upon whose age we void it up again,
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Of this escape and whither they are bound;
  With words, fair looks and liberality?
  Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
  In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
  So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
  And death approach not ere my tale be done.


MMMMDLXXVI - "DMITTEDTHERETH"

  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
  It is a thing I made, which hath the king
  The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
  To those which would not know them, and yet must
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
  Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.


MMMMDLXXVII - "USFARFORLOVEMY"

  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
  False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?
  And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
  Your legs did better service than your hands.


MMMMDLXXVIII - "LOVESUITSWEETF"

  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
  O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  It did not speak before. All solemn things
  Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
  Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
  With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
  Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.


MMMMDLXXIX - "ULFILWILLWILLF"

  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
  If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
  Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
  Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Let them not live to taste this land's increase
  Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
  I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
  Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
  Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
  Find written in the margent of his eyes.


MMMMDLXXX - "ULFILTHETREASU"

  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
  I did not: he was but a fool that brought
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
  This done, he took the bride about the neck,
  How say you, my lord? are you not content?
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  The cruel issue of these bloody men;
  Remember so weak a composition.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  A ragged and forestall'd remission.
  Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:
  Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.


MMMMDLXXXI - "REOFTHYLOVEAYF"

  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
  That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  One that still motions war and never peace,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.
  Yet let her be a principality,
  Foretell the ending of mortality.


MMMMDLXXXII - "ILLITFULLWITHW"

  I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
  Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
  I have to use: thy frank election make;
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  For native blood is counted painting now;
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
  Will do's commission throughly: and I think
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
  Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
  Was ever woman in this humour won?


MMMMDLXXXIII - "ILLSANDMYWILLO"

  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
  And go indeed, having so good a mean.
  Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
  Deliver up my title in the queen
  My body shall make good upon this earth,
  Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
  Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
  I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
  Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.


MMMMDLXXXIV - "NEINTHINGSOFGR"

  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  If haply you my father do suspect
  Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
  To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
  Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
  I'll get me one of such another length.
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
  Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  Of that and all the progress, more or less,
  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
  Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.


MMMMDLXXXV - "EATRECEIPTWITH"

  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
  Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Courageously to pluck him from his horse.
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  I thought to crush him in an equal force,
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
  What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.


MMMMDLXXXVI - "EASEWEPROVEAMO"

  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
  Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  With all appliances and means to boot,
  Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
  Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.


MMMMDLXXXVII - "NGANUMBERONEIS"

  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
  And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
  But yet I would your father had been here.
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Not better than he, by her own report.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
  Sole monarch of the universal earth.


MMMMDLXXXVIII - "RECKONDNONETHE"

  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
  Comes at the last and with a little pin
  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  Or worthily, as a good subject should,
  No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
  O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
  Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
  Him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMMDLXXXIX - "NINTHENUMBERLE"

  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  It is to jet upon a prince's right?
  Never to part with it; and here he stands;
  To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
  Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
  Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee
  Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
  But thou art all my art and dost advance
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMMMDXC - "TMEPASSUNTOLDT"

  The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
  Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Put on what weary negligence you please,
  As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
  Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
  Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
  Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
  Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
  To entertain great England's lawful king.
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.


MMMMDXCI - "HOUGHINTHYSTOR"

  Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
  O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
  Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
  Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
  He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
  Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  The dearer by I know how much an ounce.
  Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
  Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
  So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
  Rather than make unprofited return.


MMMMDXCII - "ESACCOUNTIONEM"

  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  As he was coming from this churchyard side.
  Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
  Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
  Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  That never relish'd of a base descent.
  Is not inured; return again in haste;
  Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
  Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Making another head to fight again.


MMMMDXCIII - "USTBEFORNOTHIN"

  Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
  So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
  To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
  By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
  O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  I would have made them skip. I am old now,
  Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.


MMMMDXCIV - "GHOLDMESOITPLE"

  God save the king! Will no man say amen?
  Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
  O momentary grace of mortal men,
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  My discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
  Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMMDXCV - "ASETHEEHOLDTHA"

  Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
  Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
  Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
  To bend the fatal instruments of war
  Her father is no better than an earl,
  And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!


MMMMDXCVI - "TNOTHINGMEASOM"

  The leisure and enforcement of the time
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
  He is prepared, and reason too he should:
  If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
  Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
  Go quick away; the story of my life
  My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  And this is he was his adopted heir.
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  O, God defend me! how am I beset!
  My very worthy cousin, fairly met!


MMMMDXCVII - "ETHINGSWEETTOT"

  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Than doth become a man. I will remain
  How insolent of late he is become,
  I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
  So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
  Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
  That would behold in me this shameful sport.
  Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
  They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.


MMMMDXCVIII - "HEEMAKEBUTMYNA"

  He held such petty bondage in disdain;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  My master and his man are both broke loose,
  And for his safety there I'll best devise.
  King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
  More relative than this. The play's the thing
  Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  And leave your children, wives and you in peace.


MMMMDXCIX - "METHYLOVEANDLO"

  My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
  How say you, madam, are ye so content?
  Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.


MMMMDC - "VETHATSTILLAND"

  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  That had not half a week to go, like rams
  How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
  A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
  So that by this intelligence we learn
  This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
  Into your idle over-handled theme:
  Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
  Levied an army, weening to redeem
  Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
  Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
  Did to his predecessors part withal.


MMMMDCI - "THENTHOULOVEST"

  That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  They love me well; yet I have much to do
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.
  Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  So long as youth and thou are of one date;
  Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.


MMMMDCII - "MEFORMYNAMEISW"

  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  For now I stand as one upon a rock
  O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  Now one the better, then another best;
  And on his father's; we did train him on,
  My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
  With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.


MMMMDCIII - "ILLTHOUBLINDFO"

  It is the cry of women, my good lord.
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Upon some present business of the state
  But that I did proceed upon just grounds
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  I have no will to wander forth of doors,
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  First, in this forest let us do those ends
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.


MMMMDCIV - "OLLOVEWHATDOST"

  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
  Of any thing the image tell me that
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,
  Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
  As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
  Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!


MMMMDCV - "THOUTOMINEEYES"

  The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
  He goes before me and still dares me on:
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  Unto the climate that they point upon.
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
  I give him you, the noblest that survives,
  Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  So thin that life looks through, and will break out.


MMMMDCVI - "THATTHEYBEHOLD"

  That villain Hubert told me he did live.
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  And your sweet semblance to some other give.
  This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,
  Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
  By which the world's best garden be achieved,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.


MMMMDCVII - "ANDSEENOTWHATT"

  A light condition in a beauty dark.
  No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
  Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
  Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  And his enforcement of the city wives;
  Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
  Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.


MMMMDCVIII - "HEYSEETHEYKNOW"

  Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
  He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.


MMMMDCIX - "WHATBEAUTYISSE"

  Which is not tomb enough and continent
  How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  And put on sullen black incontinent:
  Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
  By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
  Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
  They had such courage and audacity?
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  In least speak most, to my capacity.
  Since I am charged in honour and by him
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMMDCX - "EWHEREITLIESYE"

  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
  He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
  To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  I know thy constellation is right apt
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMMDCXI - "TWHATTHEBESTIS"

  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
  He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  To know what willing ransom he will give.
  Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
  Even for this let us divided live,
  But always resolute in most extremes.
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
  Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.


MMMMDCXII - "TAKETHEWORSTTO"

  Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
  Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  Since that my case is past the help of law.
  Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
  To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.


MMMMDCXIII - "BEIFEYESCORRUP"

  Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  I take it up; and by that sword I swear
  For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Reprove my allegation, if you can;
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.


MMMMDCXIV - "TBYOVERPARTIAL"

  To honour Helen and to be her knight!
  Began to scold and raise up such a storm
  You shall not be admitted to his sight.
  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
  And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
  Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
  The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
  It hath been taught us from the primal state,
  And with what danger, near the heart of it.
  Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.


MMMMDCXV - "LOOKSBEANCHORD"

  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Out, devil! I remember them too well:
  O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
  Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
  Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?


MMMMDCXVI - "INTHEBAYWHEREA"

  I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
  That him and his they in his palace burn;
  Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  But many thousand reasons hold me back.
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
  Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
  Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.


MMMMDCXVII - "LLMENRIDEWHYOF"

  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
  Let them not live to taste this land's increase
  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  If to preserve this vessel for my lord
  Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
  For then she never looks upon her lure.


MMMMDCXVIII - "EYESFALSEHOODH"

  England we love; and for that England's sake
  York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
  Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,
  And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
  Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
  Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.


MMMMDCXIX - "ASTTHOUFORGEDH"

  Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  That can assure my daughter greatest dower
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
  Unless you call it good to pity him,
  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  Here must I stay, and here my life must end.


MMMMDCXX - "OOKSWHERETOTHE"

  Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
  Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
  Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
  Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
  Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
  Things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
  Have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
  Except thou wilt except against my love.


MMMMDCXXI - "JUDGMENTOFMYHE"

  Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
  Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
  Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
  Give me superfluous death.  A noise within.
  Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
  O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
  From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
  He never would have stay'd in France so long.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.


MMMMDCXXII - "ARTISTIEDWHYSH"

  A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  The people fear me; for they do observe
  I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
  Some that will thank you, making just report
  That which so often you did bid me steal.
  I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
  Your lady's love against some other maid
  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.


MMMMDCXXIII - "OULDMYHEARTTHI"

  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  Let us not live in France; let us quit all
  Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
  Make verbal repetition of her moans;
  You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
  His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
  This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.
  His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
  I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.


MMMMDCXXIV - "NKTHATASEVERAL"

  Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
  Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
  And then I would no other company.
  Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!


MMMMDCXXV - "PLOTWHICHMYHEA"

  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Or as a moat defensive to a house,
  That damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
  Were they at wars. It is but eight years since
  How wildly then walks my estate in France!
  I long with all my heart to see the prince:
  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
  Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
  More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  And live no more to shame nor me nor you.


MMMMDCXXVI - "RTKNOWSTHEWIDE"

  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
  Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
  O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
  Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
  Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
  The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  What incidency thou dost guess of harm
  If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
  Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMMMDCXXVII - "WORLDSCOMMONPL"

  Who is as free from touch or soil with her
  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
  Drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
  So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
  Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
  May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
  Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
  O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
  Likely in time to bless a regal throne.


MMMMDCXXVIII - "ACEORMINEEYESS"

  As surfeit is the father of much fast,
  Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
  I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  You would have them always play but one thing?
  Eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
  She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
  So then two bosoms and a single troth.


MMMMDCXXIX - "EEINGTHISSAYTH"

  Even for this let us divided live,
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
  Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?


MMMMDCXXX - "ISISNOTTOPUTFA"

  I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,
  Say who art thou that lately didst descend
  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
  She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
  Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
  Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
  To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
  That him and his they in his palace burn;
  O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
  Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
  Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
  To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
  For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
  And what hear there for welcome but my groans?


MMMMDCXXXI - "IRTRUTHUPONSOF"

  Into the service of the time and was
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  Upon the country where you make abode;
  Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
  She is a theme of honour and renown,
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  For he is just and always loved us well.


MMMMDCXXXII - "OULAFACEINTHIN"

  O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Lives not this day within the city walls:
  And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
  Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
  And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
  Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  That poor retention could not so much hold,
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.


MMMMDCXXXIII - "GSRIGHTTRUEMYH"

  Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
  That he did pace them first? All things that are,
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
  Your tributary drops belong to woe,
  How to get clear of all the debts I owe.


MMMMDCXXXIV - "EARTANDEYESHAV"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
  And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
  No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  Does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Save that, for reverence to some alive,
  Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
  Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.


MMMMDCXXXV - "EERREDANDTOTHI"

  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
  Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
  And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
  No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
  Dial is now upon the prick of noon.
  To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
  Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
  To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
  His means most short, his creditors most strait:
  It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.


MMMMDCXXXVI - "SFALSEPLAGUEAR"

  See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
  Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
  And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
  Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!
  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Answer I must and shall do with my life.
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!


MMMMDCXXXVII - "ETHEYNOWTRANSF"

  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  Haply a woman's voice may do some good,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  You see this fellow that is gone before;
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  One of her women lawyer to me, for
  Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
  The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
  For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?


MMMMDCXXXVIII - "ERRDWHENMYLOVE"

  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
  How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
  Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
  Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMMDCXXXIX - "SWEARSTHATSHEI"

  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  Were all thy children kind and natural!
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  And though you call my course unnatural,
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  She will not stick to round me i' the ear,
  The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
  The holy suit which fain it would convince,
  See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
  Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!


MMMMDCXL - "SMADEOFTRUTHID"

  Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
  Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
  A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
  First, in this forest let us do those ends
  To make me slave to it; and for your sake
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
  He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
  I must be brief, lest resolution drop
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.


MMMMDCXLI - "OBELIEVEHERTHO"

  O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
  But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
  Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
  O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?


MMMMDCXLII - "UGHIKNOWSHELIE"

  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Good king, to be so mightily abused!
  Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
  If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
  Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
  Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  Or with the clamorous report of war
  Welcome him then according to his worth.
  Sticking together in calamity.
  Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.
  England and France might, through their amity,
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.


MMMMDCXLIII - "STHATSHEMIGHTT"

  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
  The mariners say how thou hast disposed
  Sir, I propose not merely to myself
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
  Give it an understanding but no tongue.
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.


MMMMDCXLIV - "HINKMESOMEUNTU"

  He might return to vasty Tartar back,
  Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
  Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  O, what a happy title do I find,
  Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
  Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.


MMMMDCXLV - "TORDYOUTHUNLEA"

  Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
  Our archers shall be placed in the midst
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
  You tender more your person's honour than
  Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.
  Unless he live until he be a man.
  Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
  Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  And she will speak most bitterly and strange.


MMMMDCXLVI - "RNEDINTHEWORLD"

  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  No less in pity than his glory which
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
  One that rejoices in the common wreck,
  Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
  Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
  Drove back again unto my native clime?


MMMMDCXLVII - "SFALSESUBTLETI"

  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
  For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
  As now they are, and making practised smiles,
  Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
  Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,
  Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
  I heard a child cry underneath a wall.


MMMMDCXLVIII - "ESTHUSVAINLYTH"

  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
  Though you perceive me not how I give line.
  Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
  Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
  So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
  In all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
  They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
  Have you importuned him by any means?


MMMMDCXLIX - "INKINGTHATSHET"

  Into the service of the time and was
  Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
  Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
  I never read but England's kings have had
  Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
  Give me some ink and paper in my tent
  To speak unto this city: what say you?
  How say you, madam, are ye so content?
  And let us swear our resolution.
  Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
  Sentenced and stay upon execution.
  How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
  Either his gracious promise, which you might,
  To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.


MMMMDCL - "HINKSMEYOUNGAL"

  Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
  I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
  My father is gone wild into his grave,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
  Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
  And oftentimes excusing of a fault
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?


MMMMDCLI - "THOUGHSHEKNOWS"

  To the ambassadors of England gives
  Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
  Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
  O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
  Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?


MMMMDCLII - "MYDAYSAREPASTT"

  Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?
  Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
  Daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?
  Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;
  You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
  Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
  And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
  And not to be a rebel to her state;
  So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
  To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.


MMMMDCLIII - "HEBESTSIMPLYIC"

  He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  But if it did infect my blood with joy,
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
  Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
  Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
  It speaks against her with the other proofs.
  Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
  You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
  I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
  Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!


MMMMDCLIV - "REDITHERFALSES"

  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out
  Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
  Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  For since the substance of your perfect self
  And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
  Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
  Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?


MMMMDCLV - "PEAKINGTONGUEO"

  Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
  Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Give me some music; music, moody food
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.


MMMMDCLVI - "NBOTHSIDESTHUS"

  Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
  But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
  Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
  Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
  Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
  Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
  Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?


MMMMDCLVII - "ISSIMPLETRUTHS"

  I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
  Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
  I should make very forges of my cheeks,
  Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
  Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
  Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
  The face, that map which deep impression bears
  How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.


MMMMDCLVIII - "UPPRESSDBUTWHE"

  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  Pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
  Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
  But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
  Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
  How tame, when men and women are alone,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.


MMMMDCLIX - "REFORESAYSSHEN"

  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Each day still better other's happiness;
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
  And that be heir to his unhappiness!
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.


MMMMDCLX - "OTSHEISUNJUSTA"

  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:
  So slight a valuation, should reserve
  Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  In resolution to keep Helen still,
  Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
  Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
  Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
  Joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
  Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
  Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.


MMMMDCLXI - "NDWHEREFORESAY"

  Not working with the eye without the ear,
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
  He shall have merely justice and his bond.
  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
  O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
  And if you love me, as you say you do,
  Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.


MMMMDCLXII - "NOTITHATIAMOLD"

  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  And then comes answer like an Absey book:
  The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
  Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
  And as the butcher takes away the calf
  Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.


MMMMDCLXIII - "OLOVESBESTHABI"

  O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
  Love loving not itself none other can.
  O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
  But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Start not; her actions shall be holy as
  That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  And whirl along with thee about the globe.
  But now the substance shall endure the like,
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.


MMMMDCLXIV - "TISINSEEMINGTR"

  They willfully themselves exile from light
  In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
  I know thy constellation is right apt
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Sticking together in calamity.
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  England and France might, through their amity,
  My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Nor the division of a battle knows
  Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
  That little thought, when she set footing here,
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


MMMMDCLXV - "USTANDAGEINLOV"

  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
  And by the royalties of both your bloods,
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
  Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
  God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
  No better than the earth he lies upon,
  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?


MMMMDCLXVI - "ELOVESNOTTOHAV"

  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
  O, torture me no more! I will confess.
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
  Of noble having and of royal hope,
  How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,
  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


MMMMDCLXVII - "EYEARSTOLDTHER"

  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Sir John, the Lord bless you; God prosper your
  That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
  To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
  He shall have merely justice and his bond.
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.


MMMMDCLXVIII - "EFOREILIEWITHH"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
  O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
  It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
  To cavil in the course of this contract:
  Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
  Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.


MMMMDCLXIX - "ERANDSHEWITHME"

  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
  And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
  I wander from the jewels that I love.
  To send for Titus TITUS, it remains,
  Here on my knee I vow to God above,
  Myself was stirring ere the break of day,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMMMDCLXX - "ANDINOURFAULTS"

  A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Did never traitor in the land commit.
  If consequence do but approve my dream,
  No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
  Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
  Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  For man or master. Then it follows thus:
  Adonis painted by a running brook,
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
  Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.


MMMMDCLXXI - "BYLIESWEFLATTE"

  Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
  You do him injury to scorn his corse.
  Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
  If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
  Love is your master, for he masters you:
  A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
  Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
  The right: but to the point. As I say, this
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.


MMMMDCLXXII - "RDBEOCALLNOTME"

  Revenge upon myself with present moan?
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
  By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
  Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
  And wears upon his baby-brow the round
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
  Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
  May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?


MMMMDCLXXIII - "TOJUSTIFYTHEWR"

  The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
  Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
  Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  Save that, for reverence to some alive,
  Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:
  I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
  For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
  You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
  This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
  Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?


MMMMDCLXXIV - "ONGTHATTHYUNKI"

  Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
  No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
  Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds
  To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
  He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
  Younger than she are happy mothers made.
  Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  I am. What must we understand by this?


MMMMDCLXXV - "NDNESSLAYSUPON"

  Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
  Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
  Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
  Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
  You are so merciful: I see your end;
  So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
  Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
  O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
  Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.


MMMMDCLXXVI - "MYHEARTWOUNDME"

  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  You follow the young Prince up and down, like
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
  The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
  Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
  O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
  Upon my wretched women, that so long
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
  Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMMDCLXXVII - "NOTWITHTHINEEY"

  Not his that spoils her young before her face.
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
  What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
  Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
  The key whereof myself have ever kept;
  How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
  The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
  Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
  I have no ears to his request. The queen
  Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.


MMMMDCLXXVIII - "EBUTWITHTHYTON"

  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
  Upon some present business of the state
  Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
  Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
  I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
  Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
  He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
  You love my son; invention is ashamed,
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
  Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.


MMMMDCLXXIX - "GUEUSEPOWERWIT"

  Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
  Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
  Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,
  Was rightful heir unto the English crown
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
  Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.


MMMMDCLXXX - "HPOWERANDSLAYM"

  His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
  Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
  Or lowly factor for another's gain;
  What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time
  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
  You heavy people, circle me about,
  My remedy is then to pluck it out.


MMMMDCLXXXI - "ENOTBYARTTELLM"

  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
  Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
  You not your child well loving, yet I find
  And shame thine honourable age with blood?
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  The face of either cipher'd either's heart;
  To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.


MMMMDCLXXXII - "ETHOULOVESTELS"

  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
  Here she exclaims against repose and rest,
  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
  Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
  Let it be who it is: for Romans now
  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  To answer mildly; for they are prepared
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.


MMMMDCLXXXIII - "EWHEREBUTINMYS"

  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Wherein we are not destitute for want,
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
  That virtue must go through. We must not stint
  I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
  So thin that life looks through, and will break out.


MMMMDCLXXXIV - "IGHTDEARHEARTF"

  I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
  Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
  Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
  That you and I should meet upon such terms
  Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
  Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
  Return again, and take an oath with thee.
  These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
  For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.


MMMMDCLXXXV - "ORBEARTOGLANCE"

  Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  But I believe, although I seem so loath,
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
  And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
  Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened thee,
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMMDCLXXXVI - "THINEEYEASIDEW"

  Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
  Devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?


MMMMDCLXXXVII - "HATNEEDSTTHOUW"

  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
  They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
  Until her husband and my lord's return:
  Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?


MMMMDCLXXXVIII - "OUNDWITHCUNNIN"

  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
  With all respect and rites of burial.
  I do believe her, though I know she lies,
  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
  Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
  Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
  In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.


MMMMDCLXXXIX - "GWHENTHYMIGHTI"

  Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
  Why would he for the momentary trick
  Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  My wish shall show me the way to my will.
  I offer'd to awaken his regard
  Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  That for thyself: I will not so presume
  I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.


MMMMDCXC - "SMORETHANMYOER"

  Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
  Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
  Of many in the army: many years,
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
  Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
  And so by many winding nooks he strays
  Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
  My lord, I found the Prince in the next room,
  Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.


MMMMDCXCI - "PRESSDDEFENSEC"

  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
  Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
  So please your majesty, I would I could
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.


MMMMDCXCII - "ANBIDELETMEEXC"

  As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  But rather wishing a more strict restraint
  I'll join with black despair against my soul,
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  This monument five hundred years hath stood,
  Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
 eXpect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Coming and going with thy honey breath.


MMMMDCXCIII - "USETHEEAHMYLOV"

  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And lookest to command the prince and realm.
  Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  Of that we have: so then we do neglect
  Very hardly upon such a subject.


MMMMDCXCIV - "EWELLKNOWSHERP"

  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
  Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
  Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
  Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  So is my love still telling what is told.
  Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Profit again should hardly draw me here.


MMMMDCXCV - "RETTYLOOKSHAVE"

  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
  That day that made my sister thirteen years.
  Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
  Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
  Of love between your daughter and himself;
  O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
  Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
  As goddess-like to her admired lays;
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMMDCXCVI - "BEENMINEENEMIE"

  Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
  If you bethink yourself of any crime
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMMDCXCVII - "SANDTHEREFOREF"

  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
  And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  For burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still,
  O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  For we will shake him, or worse days endure.


MMMMDCXCVIII - "ROMMYFACESHETU"

  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
  Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
  And so have I a noble father lost;
  Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  Summon their general unto the wall.
  His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.


MMMMDCXCIX - "RNSMYFOESTHATT"

  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
  Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life
  Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
  Might have excuse to work upon his wife,
  You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
  Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
  Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
  That taught his son the office of a fowl!
  Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
  And my imaginations are as foul
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.


MMMMDCC - "HEYELSEWHEREMI"

  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Were I with her, the night would post too soon;
  Have I once lived to see two honest men?
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
  I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.


MMMMDCCI - "GHTDARTTHEIRIN"

  Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
  Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
  The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
  Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
  And never wound the heart with looks again;
  Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
  To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  The king hath many marching in his coats.
  He that flies so will ne'er return again.
  Eating the air and promise of supply,
  It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
  Religious love put out Religion's eye:
  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.


MMMMDCCII - "JURIESYETDONOT"

  James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
  Upon my lady's missing, came to me
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
  Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  To hear the replication of your sounds
  Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
  They may vex us with shot, or with assault.


MMMMDCCIII - "SOBUTSINCEIAMN"

  So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
  Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
  But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
  Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
  To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
  Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
  And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
  My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!


MMMMDCCIV - "EARSLAINKILLME"

  Early and late, debating to and fro
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
  Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
  Swear in both the scales against either scale;
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  Are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  I would not be a young count in your way,
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
  Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MMMMDCCV - "OUTRIGHTWITHLO"

  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  That from it all consideration slips!
  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
  Give him that parting kiss which I had set
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
  When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
  I'll be your father and your brother too;
  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
  Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.


MMMMDCCVI - "OKSANDRIDMYPAI"

  O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
  And, by the necessary form of this,
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
  Discover more at large what cause that was,
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
  Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
  And all the number of his fair demands
  It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.


MMMMDCCVII - "NBEWISEASTHOUA"

  Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
  But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
  I rather of his absence make this use:
  She's not well married that lives married long;
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong;
  Set down, set down your honourable load,
  They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:
  Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
  Unto another lady of esteem:
  And sits as one new risen from a dream.


MMMMDCCVIII - "RTCRUELDONOTPR"

  Reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
  To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
  Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  On, officer, to prison till it come.
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  That this my death may never be forgot!
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!


MMMMDCCIX - "ESSMYTONGUETIE"

  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
  Such commendations as becomes a maid,
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
  They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Never to marry but by my free leave?
  Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
  That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  I am content you shall entreat me stay;
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


MMMMDCCX - "DPATIENCEWITHT"

  Delighted them in any other form;
  Pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
  And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
  To keep his daughter company; whose loves
  I will be correspondent to command
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
  Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Whene'er we come to our account.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
  Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
  That tremble at the imagination?


MMMMDCCXI - "OOMUCHDISDAINL"

  On such a full sea are we now afloat;
  On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
  He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.


MMMMDCCXII - "ESTSORROWLENDM"

  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  Many will swoon when they do look on blood.


MMMMDCCXIII - "EWORDSANDWORDS"

  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
  She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
  And then all this thou seest is but a clod
  Not letting it decline on the declined,
  Doth want example: who hath read or heard
  Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
  O my good lord, the world is but a word:
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
  Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.


MMMMDCCXIV - "EXPRESSTHEMANN"

  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
 eXtremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
  So far from variation or quick change?
  The fountain from the which my current runs,
  He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
  Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
  No grief did ever come so near thy heart
  No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.


MMMMDCCXV - "EROFMYPITYWANT"

  Either to get the town again or die:
  Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
  O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
  For that he knew you, might reproach your life
  Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.
  You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
  Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
  I hear it by the way; but I will send:
  This picture she advisedly perused,
  Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
  Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
  And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
  Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
  The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!


MMMMDCCXVI - "INGPAINIFIMIGH"

  I will be master of what is mine own-
  No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
  Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
  And not all love to see you, though so much
  I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
  No glory lives behind the back of such.
  Indeed we heard how near his death he was
  For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
  If she have time to breathe be well assured
  Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
  It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?


MMMMDCCXVII - "TTEACHTHEEWITB"

  The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  As level as the cannon to his blank,
  Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
  Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
  Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
  How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
  That hath been breeder of these dire events.
  Big discontent so breaking their contents.


MMMMDCCXVIII - "ETTERITWERETHO"

  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
  That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  To cross my friend in his intended drift
  With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
  Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
  Old Helicanus goes along behind.


MMMMDCCXIX - "UGHNOTTOLOVEYE"

  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
  However God or fortune cast my lot,
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
  The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
  That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMMMDCCXX - "TLOVETOTELLMES"

  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
  Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Speak with me, pity me, open the door.


MMMMDCCXXI - "OASTESTYSICKME"

  Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
  And on his more advice we pardon him.
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
  These banish'd men that I have kept withal
  Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
  Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
  In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
  Come pat betwixt too early and too late
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  March to assault thy country than to tread--
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMMMDCCXXII - "NWHENTHEIRDEAT"

  Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
  Who, you all know, are honourable men:
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
  Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
  Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
  It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;
  That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.


MMMMDCCXXIII - "HSBENEARNONEWS"

  Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
  See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
  Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  And therefore to your fair no painting set;
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  No more pains for those thanks than you took pains
  Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,
  Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
  She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.


MMMMDCCXXIV - "BUTHEALTHFROMT"

  Because we know, on Valentine's report,
  Unless he take the course that you have done,
  The chain were longer and the letter short?
  Had I before known this young man his son,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  A thievish living on the common road?
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  Than death can yield me here by my abode.
  How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
  Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
  Rain added to a river that is rank
  O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
  My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
  That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?


MMMMDCCXXV - "HEIRPHYSICIANS"

  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  I will both hear and grant you your requests.
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
  How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
  Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
  And his offence is so, as it appears,
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.


MMMMDCCXXVI - "KNOWFORIFISHOU"

  Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
  Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
  Or any of my brothers of the state,
  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
  Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
  For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
  I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
  Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
  Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
  O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.


MMMMDCCXXVII - "LDDESPAIRISHOU"

  Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
  Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
  And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
  I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  I make my love engrafted to this store:
  Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
  Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.


MMMMDCCXXVIII - "LDGROWMADANDIN"

  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,
  What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
  Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
  And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  And not a man of them that we shall take
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.


MMMMDCCXXIX - "MYMADNESSMIGHT"

  Mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
  Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
  Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
  Small time, but in that small most greatly lived
  My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
  God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
  That will forsake thee and go home in peace.


MMMMDCCXXX - "SPEAKILLOFTHEE"

  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
  Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
  Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
  O' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
  Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
  To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.


MMMMDCCXXXI - "NOWTHISILLWRES"

  Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
  O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
  To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
  His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
  I am undone: there is no living, none,
  She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
  I am my father's heir and only son;
  Let me persuade you take a better course.
  Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
  With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.


MMMMDCCXXXII - "TINGWORLDISGRO"

  The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
  If we obey them not, this will ensue,
  Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
  Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
  Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
  Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
  Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
  I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
  Give order to my servants that they take
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Of a glad father compass thee about!


MMMMDCCXXXIII - "WNSOBADMADSLAN"

  Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
  Out of my lean and low ability
  But heaven hath a hand in these events,
  As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
  Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
  Must I do so? and must I ravel out
  And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  As I for praise alone now seek to spill
  Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?


MMMMDCCXXXIV - "DERERSBYMADEAR"

  Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
  Such as I am: though for myself alone
  Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
  Yes, something you can deny for your own
  Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
  Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.


MMMMDCCXXXV - "SBELIEVEDBETHA"

  Set your entreatments at a higher rate
  But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
  Being so great, I have no need to beg.
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,
  Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
  And whirl along with thee about the globe.


MMMMDCCXXXVI - "TIMAYNOTBESONO"

  This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
  In very likeness of a roasted crab,
  My chaplain to no creature living, but
  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  O, torture me no more! I will confess.
  The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
  Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  No, truly; it is more than manners will:
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!


MMMMDCCXXXVII - "RTHOUBELIEDBEA"

  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
  He would not stay at your petitions: made
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  Unto the crown of France. That you may know
  Be happy that my arms are out of use:
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.


MMMMDCCXXXVIII - "RTHINEEYESSTRA"

  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass
  His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
  Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
  Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
  So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
  The lion moved with pity did endure
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.


MMMMDCCXXXIX - "IGHTTHOUGHTHYP"

  In argument and proof of which contract,
  Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
  To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  Upon their ancient malice will forget
  Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
  Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  Henry is dead and never shall revive:
  Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
  Pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.


MMMMDCCXL - "ROUDHEARTGOWID"

  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Or what is now received: I witness to
  Upon his royal face there is no note
  Definitively thus I answer you.
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  And hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
  Rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
  God safely quit her of her burthen, and
  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
  We must give up to Diomedes' hand
  I did some service; of such note indeed,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.


MMMMDCCXLI - "EINFAITHIDONOT"

  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
  For more it is than I can well express:
  And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
  It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
  The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
  Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
  I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Or is the adder better than the eel
  Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.


MMMMDCCXLII - "LOVETHEEWITHMI"

  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
  I do obey thee till I give thee bail.


MMMMDCCXLIII - "NEEYESFORTHEYI"

  No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
  Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
  Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
  Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  You know an enemy intends you harm;
  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?


MMMMDCCXLIV - "NTHEEATHOUSAND"

  No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
  The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
  His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
  Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
  Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
  Since we can not atone you, we shall see
  And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
  Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
  Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!


MMMMDCCXLV - "ERRORSNOTEBUTT"

  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  But this effusion of such manly drops,
  Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
  To cozen him that would unjustly win.


MMMMDCCXLVI - "ISMYHEARTTHATL"

  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
  Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
  Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
  As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
  To-morrow in the battle think on me,
  Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!


MMMMDCCXLVII - "OVESWHATTHEYDE"

  O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  So nightly toils the subject of the land,
  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
  The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
  Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.


MMMMDCCXLVIII - "SPISEWHOINDESP"

  Strangely neglected? when did he regard
  Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  So much as from occasion you may glean,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Welcome him then according to his worth.
  Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
  Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.


MMMMDCCXLIX - "ITEOFVIEWISPLE"

  In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
  Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
  For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
  Values itself so highly that to her
  If he were living, I would try him yet.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
  I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
  Still question'd me the story of my life,
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
  Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMDCCL - "ASEDTODOTENORA"

  A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
  Or that or any place that harbours men.
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  And happy newness, that intends old right.


MMMMDCCLI - "REMINEEARSWITH"

  Ready to catch each other by the throat,
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
  I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  As where's that palace whereinto foul things
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
  Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
  If I could add a lie unto a fault,
  That is so proud thy service to despise,
  He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.


MMMMDCCLII - "THYTONGUESTUNE"

  That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
  Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
  This is a letter of your own device.
  Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMMMDCCLIII - "DELIGHTEDNORTE"

  Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
  God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
  He is as worthy for an empress' love
  Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.


MMMMDCCLIV - "NDERFEELINGTOB"

  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Do more than counterpoise a full third part
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
  For we no longer are defensible.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Each part in me that were but sensible:
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  Give order to my servants that they take
  That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
  By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?


MMMMDCCLV - "ASETOUCHESPRON"

  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
  Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  That will with two pernicious daughters join
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
  Ceremony was but devised at first
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
  Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
  Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
  Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
  Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!


MMMMDCCLVI - "ENORTASTENORSM"

  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
  Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
  She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
  Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
  Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
  My guilt be on my head, and there an end.


MMMMDCCLVII - "ELLDESIRETOBEI"

  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
  Like fragments in hard voyages, became
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
  I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-
  O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
  But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  In states unborn and accents yet unknown!


MMMMDCCLVIII - "NVITEDTOANYSEN"

  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
  To dispossess that child which is not his?
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
  That fell away have entertainment, but
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
  Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
  You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.


MMMMDCCLIX - "SUALFEASTWITHT"

  So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
  And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
  Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
  For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  As I can take it with another herb,
  Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
  The next degree is England's royal throne;
  While she, the picture of pure piety,
  Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.


MMMMDCCLX - "HEEALONEBUTMYF"

  He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  And all the peers and nobles of the realm
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  But the protractive trials of great Jove
  Upon this business my appearance make
  Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
  May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
  You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
  Foretell new storms to those already spent.


MMMMDCCLXI - "IVEWITSNORMYFI"

  I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
  I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
  Thou already, that seest not thy loss in
  She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
  In aspiration lifts him from the earth.


MMMMDCCLXII - "VESENSESCANDIS"

  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
  Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
  Either for life or death, upon the earth
  So many summers dry; scarce any joy
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  And then all this thou seest is but a clod
  Not what you are, I know it will excuse
  Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
  I think I shall command your welcome here,
  Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.


MMMMDCCLXIII - "SUADEONEFOOLIS"

  So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,
  Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
  Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
  Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
  I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
  Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.


MMMMDCCLXIV - "HHEARTFROMSERV"

  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
  The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
  Fortune had left to both of us alike
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
  My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
  So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMMMDCCLXV - "INGTHEEWHOLEAV"

  It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
  Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
  Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
  Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
  How fain would I have hated all mankind!
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.
  He does deny him, in respect of his,
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Love is too young to know what conscience is;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  And for this cause awhile we must neglect
  Very hardly upon such a subject.


MMMMDCCLXVI - "ESUNSWAYDTHELI"

  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  Submissive fall his princely feet before,
  We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
  Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
  To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  I wish you well, and so I take my leave.


MMMMDCCLXVII - "KENESSOFAMANTH"

  Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Nor I nor any man that but man is
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
  Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
  O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing
  Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
  Are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
  My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
  At their money: these debts may well be called
  Noble she is, but if she have forgot
  The rather by these arguments of fear,
  How many goodly creatures are there here!


MMMMDCCLXVIII - "YPROUDHEARTSSL"

  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
  Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
  That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
  Says that you savour too much of your youth,
  Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
  Looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.


MMMMDCCLXIX - "AVEANDVASSALWR"

  An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  England did never owe so sweet a hope,
  And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
  Nativity, once in the main of light,
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
  See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
  Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
  As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.


MMMMDCCLXX - "ETCHTOBEONLYMY"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  That I should seem to lack humanity
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity:
  Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
  O, they love least that let men know their love.
  By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
  Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
  Your potent and infectious fevers heap
  My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  You see how simple and how fond I am.


MMMMDCCLXXI - "PLAGUETHUSFARI"

  Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
  Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
  And of their feather many more proud birds,
  Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
  Had I it written, I would tear the word.
  Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
  Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
  Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
  As if the boy should use like loving charms;
  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
  I take my leave with many thousand thanks.


MMMMDCCLXXII - "COUNTMYGAINTHA"

  Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
  Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
  They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
  Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
  Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
  Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
  And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
  I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
  Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
  Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
  And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.


MMMMDCCLXXIII - "TSHETHATMAKESM"

  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
  And this deceit loses the name of craft,
  Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
  My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.


MMMMDCCLXXIV - "ESINAWARDSMEPA"

  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
  I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
  Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
  And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
  My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
  Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.


MMMMDCCLXXV - "INLOVEISMYSINA"

  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  Matter against him that for ever mars
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
  It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
  Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.


MMMMDCCLXXVI - "NDTHYDEARVIRTU"

  None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
  Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
  He doth intend she shall be England's queen.
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
  Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.


MMMMDCCLXXVII - "EHATEHATEOFMYS"

  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  How doth my lady? Is my father well?
  And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
  Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
  And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
  That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
  May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
  Your children were vexation to your youth,
  Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?


MMMMDCCLXXVIII - "INGROUNDEDONSI"

  In weeping after this untimely bier.
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
  Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
  Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
  Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
  So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
  If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.


MMMMDCCLXXIX - "NFULLOVINGOBUT"

  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  For I would commune with you of such things
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
  Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  I must have patience to endure the load:
  Never, before this day, in all his life.
  Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
  O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
  But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
  Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
  That death in me at others' lives may laugh.


MMMMDCCLXXX - "WITHMINECOMPAR"

  Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
  I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
  The current that with gentle murmur glides,
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  In his own conduct, purposely to take
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
  Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
  Rome will despise her for this foul escape.


MMMMDCCLXXXI - "ETHOUTHINEOWNS"

  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  To whom this wreath of victory I give,
  He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  Have I not heard these islanders shout out
  I answer is most false. The duke by law
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
  Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
  No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
  Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.


MMMMDCCLXXXII - "TATEANDTHOUSHA"

  That winter lion, who in rage forgets
  An esperance so obstinately strong,
  Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And in thy best consideration check
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
  That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
  Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
  Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
  Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
  Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
  However faulty, yet should find respect
  All that may men approve or men detect!


MMMMDCCLXXXIII - "LTFINDITMERITS"

  Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
  For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  Do more than counterpoise a full third part
  It were a better death than die with mocks,
  The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
  My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
  I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?


MMMMDCCLXXXIV - "NOTREPROVINGOR"

  Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Only in this disguise I think't no sin
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.


MMMMDCCLXXXV - "IFITDONOTFROMT"

  Is nothing left me but my body's length.
  For nothing canst thou to damnation add
  Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
  The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
  Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
  Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,
  Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
  O, how I faint when I of you do write,
  Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.


MMMMDCCLXXXVI - "HOSELIPSOFTHIN"

  Her mother, ever strong against that match
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
  In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
  Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
  For two and twenty sons I never wept,
  Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
  Had all your quarters been as safely kept
  If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,
  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?


MMMMDCCLXXXVII - "ETHATHAVEPROFA"

  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
  Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
  Presentation of that he shoots his wit.
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  O, throw away the worser part of it,
  From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
  Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?


MMMMDCCLXXXVIII - "NEDTHEIRSCARLE"

  Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  He only lived but till he was a man;
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Is it no more to be your daughter than
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
  As gentle tell me, of what honour was
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Losing his verdure even in the prime
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMMDCCLXXXIX - "TORNAMENTSANDS"

  Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
  Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones;
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  And do you now strew flowers in his way
  Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
  This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
  Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
  Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
  So many miles with a pretence? this place?


MMMMDCCXC - "EALDFALSEBONDS"

  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  And ever and anon they made a doubt
  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
  For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
  And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
  Lays open all the little worms that creep;
  So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
  On either side I come to spend my breath;
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?


MMMMDCCXCI - "OFLOVEASOFTASM"

  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
  Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  And yet salt water blinds them not so much
  So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
  This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
  And here he means to spend his time awhile:
  Save that, for reverence to some alive,
  Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


MMMMDCCXCII - "INEROBBDOTHERS"

  I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
  Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  But you shall shine more bright in these contents
  Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
  Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
  Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
  That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
  Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!


MMMMDCCXCIII - "BEDSREVENUESOF"

  Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
  O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!
  For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.


MMMMDCCXCIV - "THEIRRENTSBEIT"

  The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
  Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
  This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  I did suppose it should be on constraint:
  That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.


MMMMDCCXCV - "LAWFULILOVETHE"

  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  And, like her true nobility, she has
  Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
  For we intend so to dispose you as
  Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  One on another's neck, do witness bear
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
  Hath he excepted most against my love.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMMDCCXCVI - "EASTHOULOVESTT"

  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
  Save when command to your dismission tends,
  Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
  Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
  O my dear father, restoration hang
  Under your good correction, I have seen,
  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
  On Tuesday last to listen after news.
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-
  To desperation turn my trust and hope,
  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!


MMMMDCCXCVII - "HOSEWHOMTHINEE"

  Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.
  Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
  Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
  Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
  How joyful am I made by this contract!
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
  The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
  Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


MMMMDCCXCVIII - "YESWOOASMINEIM"

  Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
  Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
  So swift a pace hath thought that even now
  Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
  A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
  Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
  Even for this let us divided live,
  I see, as in a map, the end of all.
  Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.


MMMMDCCXCIX - "PORTUNETHEEROO"

  Prove you that any man with me conversed
  O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  This his good melancholy oft began,
  Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
  O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!


MMMMDCCC - "TPITYINTHYHEAR"

  The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
  Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  There is a remedy, approved, set down,
  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Too good to be so and too bad to live,
  Hostility and civil tumult reigns
  Your faithful service and your toil in war;
  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.


MMMMDCCCI - "TTHATWHENITGRO"

  Than is my deed to my most painted word.
  These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay.
  That he his high authority abused,
  Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
  I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
  To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
  Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
  Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
  Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.


MMMMDCCCII - "WSTHYPITYMAYDE"

  Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
  He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
  You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
  Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
  I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
  Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
  Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
  And so I would be here, but that I doubt
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMMDCCCIII - "SERVETOPITIEDB"

  She that was ever fair and never proud,
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
  Out of mine own; his days and times are past
  Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
  If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
  To France, to France, and get what you have lost;
  It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
  By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.


MMMMDCCCIV - "EIFTHOUDOSTSEE"

  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
  For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
  That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
  Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  Under the colour of commending him,
  Dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
  To match us in comparisons with dirt,
  Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.


MMMMDCCCV - "KTOHAVEWHATTHO"

  Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
  To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
  Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
  Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
  And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Even in the presence of the crowned king.
  Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
  To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
  Think you I can a resolution fetch
  He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
  Or sells eternity to get a toy?


MMMMDCCCVI - "UDOSTHIDEBYSEL"

  Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
  Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
  O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
  Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
  Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
  But prosper better than the Trojan did.
  Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Live, and beget a happy race of kings!


MMMMDCCCVII - "FEXAMPLEMAYSTT"

  For being ignorant to whom it goes
  Establish him in his true sense again,
 eXcept it be to pray against thy foes.
  And he is bred out of that bloody strain
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
  Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
  So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
  The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
  Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.


MMMMDCCCVIII - "HOUBEDENIEDLOA"

  His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
  Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
  Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
  Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
  And he to yours, and all of you to God's!


MMMMDCCCIX - "SACAREFULHOUSE"

  Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
  And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,
  Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
  And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
  Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
  Like witless antics, one another meet,
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


MMMMDCCCX - "WIFERUNSTOCATC"

  Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
  I know where I will wear this dagger then;
  From first to last, the onset and retire
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
  She's far enough; and what he learns by this
  The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
  Only compound me with forgotten dust;
  Come pat betwixt too early and too late
  And most deceiving when it seems most just;
  Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
  Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.


MMMMDCCCXI - "HONEOFHERFEATH"

  He would quickly have the gift of a grave.
  O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
  Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  O, never say that I was false of heart,
  Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Razing the characters of your renown,
  Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
  To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.


MMMMDCCCXII - "ERDCREATURESBR"

  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
  Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
  Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
  Entreated me to call and know her mind:
  And of a dragon and a finless fish,
  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  By all your vows of love and that great vow
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMMDCCCXIII - "OKEAWAYSETSDOW"

  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
  We made each other but so late ago.
  An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
  You would all this time have proved there is no
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
  What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.


MMMMDCCCXIV - "NHERBABEANDMAK"

  Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
  Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  But that I think his father loves him not
  As I bethink me, you should not be king
  But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
  And call upon my soul within the house;
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  More feeling-painful: let it then suffice
  A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
  Know I these men that come along with you?


MMMMDCCCXV - "ESANSWIFTDISPA"

  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
  And in thy best consideration check
  Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
  Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
  I, his sole son, do this same villain send
  Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
  The truth is then most done not doing it:
  Defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
  I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
  Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
  And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!


MMMMDCCCXVI - "TCHINPURSUITOF"

  That this his love was an eternal plant,
  Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
  Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
  Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.


MMMMDCCCXVII - "THETHINGSHEWOU"

  To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
  He likewise gives a frock or livery,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  That he would labour my delivery.
  He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
  I was directed hither: men report
  Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
  Go, call before me all the lords in court.
  Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
  Heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.


MMMMDCCCXVIII - "LDHAVESTAYWHIL"

  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
  An't please your grace, the two great cardinals
  Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
  Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
  And so, ere answer knows what question would,
  Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
  Was this inserted to make interest good?
  How full of valour did he bear himself
  If I did stay to look on his intents.
  Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!


MMMMDCCCXIX - "STHERNEGLECTED"

  Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
  Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
  How can they then assist me in the act?
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
  Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
  Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.


MMMMDCCCXX - "CHILDHOLDSHERI"

  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
  I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
  His honour and the greatness of his name
  O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!
  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
  How well resembles it the prime of youth,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.


MMMMDCCCXXI - "NCHASECRIESTOC"

  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
  And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
  Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
  Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
  Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?


MMMMDCCCXXII - "ATCHHERWHOSEBU"

  Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
  To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
  Came not till now to dignify the times,
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
  He hath but as offended in a dream!
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.


MMMMDCCCXXIII - "SYCAREISBENTTO"

  Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
  You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
  And happily may your sweet self put on
  Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Imagination. There's money for thee.
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  This might have been prevented and made whole
  O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!


MMMMDCCCXXIV - "FOLLOWTHATWHIC"

  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Oft does them by the weakest minister:
  Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
  To keep the oath that we administer:
  Her face the book of praises, where is read
  Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
  Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
  Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
  Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
  Is it no more to be your daughter than
  Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?


MMMMDCCCXXV - "HFLIESBEFOREHE"

  Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
  For it is known we were but hollow friends:
  Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
  I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
  By some illusion see thou bring her here:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  He came too late, the ship was under sail:
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MMMMDCCCXXVI - "RFACENOTPRIZIN"

  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
  All our merry meetings on the plains,
  Could force his soul so to his own conceit
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Of what she was no semblance did remain:
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  Possess the people in Messina here
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
  Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
  It lifted up it head and did address
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?


MMMMDCCCXXVII - "GHERPOORINFANT"

  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
  Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
  To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.


MMMMDCCCXXVIII - "SDISCONTENTSOR"

  Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
  Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
  I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
  So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
  This token serveth for a flag of truce
  Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  Rot and consume themselves in little time.


MMMMDCCCXXIX - "UNNSTTHOUAFTER"

  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
  Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
  Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
  And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
  For he that brought them, in the very heat
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MMMMDCCCXXX - "THATWHICHFLIES"

  To blot old books and alter their contents,
  Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
  And--God consigning to my good intents-
  Than history can pattern, though devised
  What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
  Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
  If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
  Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
  Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!


MMMMDCCCXXXI - "FROMTHEEWHILST"

  Forage in blood of French nobility.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Out of my lean and low ability
  My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
  That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
  Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
  How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
  I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
  Lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
  Say it did so a little time before
  To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.


MMMMDCCCXXXII - "ITHYBABECHASET"

  I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
  To lead out many to the Holy Land,
  Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
  Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
  By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
  And not a man of them shall have the grace,
  By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
  He that will think to live till he be old,
  As surely as my soul intends to live
  Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
  England and France might, through their amity,
  To bear the tidings of calamity.


MMMMDCCCXXXIII - "HEEAFARBEHINDB"

  Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
  For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
  Although she knows my days are past the best,
  Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
  Bend their best studies, heartily request
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  He might have took his answer long ago.
  I play the torturer, by small and small
  Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
  Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
  By any understanding pate but thine?


MMMMDCCCXXXIV - "UTIFTHOUCATCHT"

  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
  It would become me better than to close
  For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
  This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
  Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
  Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
  And with a great heart heave away the storm:
  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
  Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  To strive for that which resteth in my choice.


MMMMDCCCXXXV - "HYHOPETURNBACK"

  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.
  He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  Philip of France, in right and true behalf
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
  Under her other was the tender boy,
  Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
  Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
  But we are spirits of another sort:
  And all in vain you strive against the stream;
  Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
  Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!


MMMMDCCCXXXVI - "TOMEANDPLAYTHE"

  Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
  Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
  My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
  Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  Let in that amity which you have made;
  Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
  You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
  To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.


MMMMDCCCXXXVII - "MOTHERSPARTKIS"

  Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  The basin that receives your guilty blood.
  Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
  Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
  Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  That tide will stay me longer than I should.
  Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
  I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?


MMMMDCCCXXXVIII - "SMEBEKINDSOWIL"

  So be my grave my peace as here I give
  My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
  Even for this let us divided live,
  But in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
  Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
  Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
  It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.


MMMMDCCCXXXIX - "LIPRAYTHATTHOU"

  Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
  In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;
  Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
  He might have bought me at a common price:
  As touching France, to give a greater sum
  Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
  The laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.
  He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.


MMMMDCCCXL - "MAYSTHAVETHYWI"

  My life I never held but as a pawn
  And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
  Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
  Subject and servile to all discontents,
  That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
  How under my oppression I did reek,
  Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
  I lost my liberty and they their lives.


MMMMDCCCXLI - "LLIFTHOUTURNBA"

  Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
  Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
  In her consists my happiness and thine;
  For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
  Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
  He gives me so much of mine own, as I
  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
  Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
  The king is set from London; and the scene
  Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;
  A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!


MMMMDCCCXLII - "CKANDMYLOUDCRY"

  Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
  Knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
  An ancient angel coming down the hill
  Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
  My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
  Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
  Or never after look me in the face:
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
  Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.


MMMMDCCCXLIII - "INGSTILLTWOLOV"

  If I do feign, you witnesses above
  No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
  Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  Too good to be so and too bad to live,
  I will assume thy part in some disguise
  Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
  Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
  Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
  With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?


MMMMDCCCXLIV - "ESIHAVEOFCOMFO"

  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
  If you do love me, you will find me out.
  His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
  A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  Of English Henry, shall this night appear
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
  For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
  O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!


MMMMDCCCXLV - "RTANDDESPAIRWH"

  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  To be your comforter when he is gone.
  And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Procure me music ready when he wakes,
  A vision of the Island, one dear son
  I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.


MMMMDCCCXLVI - "ICHLIKETWOSPIR"

  Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
  Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  If you will lead these graces to the grave
  Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
  Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;
  Of this proud king, who studies day and night
  See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
  Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
  I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
  Receiving them from such a worthless post.


MMMMDCCCXLVII - "ITSDOSUGGESTME"

  It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
  Say that before Ascension-day at noon
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
  Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
  Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
  Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
  Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.


MMMMDCCCXLVIII - "STILLTHEBETTER"

  So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
  Than history can pattern, though devised
  I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
  Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
  Let her who would be rid of him devise
  Though their injunction be to bar my doors
  How shall I dote on her with more advice,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
  To me or my swift passage, that I slide
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.


MMMMDCCCXLIX - "ANGELISAMANRIG"

  As, in reproof of many tales devised,
  Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
  Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
  Saving your merry humour, here's the note
  And four shall quickly draw out my command,
  Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
  And bring him out that is but woman's son
  Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  Go, stand within; let me alone with him.


MMMMDCCCL - "HTFAIRTHEWORSE"

  How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
  And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
  Infected as her life, she would not live
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  That honour saved may upon asking give?
  How that ambitious Constance would not cease
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
  Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
  Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMDCCCLI - "RSPIRITAWOMANC"

  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
  Supposing it a thing impossible-
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  In all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
  This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
  And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
  Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  Corrupting in its own fertility.


MMMMDCCCLII - "OLOURDILLTOWIN"

  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
  If that thy father live, let him repent
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
  Or with the clamorous report of war
  Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
  I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
  Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.


MMMMDCCCLIII - "MESOONTOHELLMY"

  Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
  Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
  Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
  Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
  Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
  My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
  You know there wants no junkets at the feast.


MMMMDCCCLIV - "FEMALEEVILTEMP"

  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
  Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
  Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
  Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.


MMMMDCCCLV - "TETHMYBETTERAN"

  Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,
  Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  Your heart is full of something that does take
  By sovereignty of nature. First he was
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  That any purblind eye may find it out.
  The better arm you to the sudden time,
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
  No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.


MMMMDCCCLVI - "GELFROMMYSIDEA"

  Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
  From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  My ancient incantations are too weak,
  Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
  Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  As shall with either part's agreement stand?


MMMMDCCCLVII - "NDWOULDCORRUPT"

  No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
  Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
  Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
  Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
  Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
  The loss of such a lord includes all harm.


MMMMDCCCLVIII - "MYSAINTTOBEADE"

  More said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Since she is living, let the time run on
  Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
  I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
  Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
  Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
  But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!


MMMMDCCCLIX - "VILWOOINGHISPU"

  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  I rather of his absence make this use:
  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
  When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!
  Of threescore and two years; a silly time
  Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
  In the division of each several crime,
  Not of this country, though my chance is now
  Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
  How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
  I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.


MMMMDCCCLX - "RITYWITHHERFOU"

  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
  I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
  That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  For who love I so much? And now who knows
  Or is he but retired to make him strong?
  Under whose government come they along?


MMMMDCCCLXI - "LPRIDEANDWHETH"

  Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
  Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  In England work your grace's full content.
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
  Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
  Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


MMMMDCCCLXII - "ERTHATMYANGELB"

  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
  The strong necessity of time commands
  Here on my knee I vow to God above,
  And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
  Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
  You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
  No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:
  Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
  But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.


MMMMDCCCLXIII - "ETURNDFIENDSUS"

  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  No; for he could not so resign his crown
  Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
  For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
  If Richard will be true, not that alone
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Diana's temple is not distant far,
  So should my papers yellow'd with their age
  Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
  Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.


MMMMDCCCLXIV - "PECTIMAYBUTNOT"

  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
  The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
  Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
  Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
  Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
  That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
  Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.


MMMMDCCCLXV - "DIRECTLYTELLBU"

  Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
  The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
  Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
  To gratify his noble service that
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Let me have men about me that are fat;
  Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
  Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.


MMMMDCCCLXVI - "TBEINGBOTHFROM"

  The mercy that was quick in us but late,
  By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  If life did ride upon a dial's point,
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
  Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
  Hostility and civil tumult reigns
  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.


MMMMDCCCLXVII - "MEBOTHTOEACHFR"

  Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  But let desert in pure election shine,
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  The little number of your doubtful friends.
  Husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
  There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
  Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMMMDCCCLXVIII - "IENDIGUESSONEA"

  I shall receive the money for the same.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
  If ever any malice in your heart
  Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
  Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
  Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.


MMMMDCCCLXIX - "NGELINANOTHERS"

  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Give the dozen white luces in their coat.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
  I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
  Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
  And that I have possess'd him my most stay
  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  Of things to come at large. It is supposed
  To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Save what is had or must from you be took.


MMMMDCCCLXX - "HELLYETTHISSHA"

  Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,
  Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
  Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  You must forget to be a woman; change
  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
  Importing the surrender of those lands
  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
  Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
  Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
  Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?


MMMMDCCCLXXI - "LLINEERKNOWBUT"

  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
  Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
  Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
  Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
  O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
  By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.


MMMMDCCCLXXII - "LIVEINDOUBTTIL"

  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Do me but right, and you must all confess
  Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
  Urge the necessity and state of times,
  By such invention as I can devise?
  These accusations and these grievous crimes
  To give the onset to thy good advice.
  In process of the seasons have I seen,
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.


MMMMDCCCLXXIII - "LMYBADANGELFIR"

  Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
  Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
  You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
  By which the world's best garden be achieved,
  A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
  Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
  Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
  Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
  Impostors to true fear, would well become
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!


MMMMDCCCLXXIV - "EMYGOODONEOUTT"

  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
  O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Or did the letters work upon his blood,
  Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
  They will digest this harsh indignity.


MMMMDCCCLXXV - "HOSELIPSTHATLO"

  His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
  Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
  The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
  He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
  And my imaginations are as foul
  The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
  Like men born to renown by life or death.
  Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.


MMMMDCCCLXXVI - "VESOWNHANDDIDM"

  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
  Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
  No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
  He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
  No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
  Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
  Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
  My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.


MMMMDCCCLXXVII - "AKEBREATHEDFOR"

  Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
  Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
  Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
  Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
  O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
  Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.


MMMMDCCCLXXVIII - "THTHESOUNDTHAT"

  Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
  He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
  There is a gentleman that serves the count
  Hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
  Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
  Nothing, unless you render her again.
  Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
  Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
  To put good meat into an unclean dish.


MMMMDCCCLXXIX - "SAIDIHATETOMET"

  Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
  And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
  If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
  Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
  Is not inured; return again in haste;
  He that has and a little tiny wit-
  And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
  Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  To know the reason of this strange restraint.
  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
  My sable ground of sin I will not paint,
  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.


MMMMDCCCLXXX - "HATLANGUISHDFO"

  Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
  Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
  No; I will sit and watch here by the King.
  Grew a companion to the common streets,
  Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
  So many hours must I tend my flock;
  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
  Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
  For which I must not plead, but that I am
  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?


MMMMDCCCLXXXI - "RHERSAKEBUTWHE"

  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Happy in this, she is not yet so old
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
  Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
  Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
  But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
  William, how many numbers is in nouns?
  His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.


MMMMDCCCLXXXII - "NSHESAWMYWOEFU"

  Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
  See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
  Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
  Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
  Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
  York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;
  Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
  O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
  Unto the climate that they point upon.


MMMMDCCCLXXXIII - "LSTATESTRAIGHT"

  Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  A thievish living on the common road?
  That cannot so much as a blossom yield
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
  To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  And your reports have set the murder on.
  I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
  Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
  Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
  Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.


MMMMDCCCLXXXIV - "INHERHEARTDIDM"

  If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  Nan Page my daughter and my little son
  Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
  Rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
  That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  I am content that he shall take the odds
  Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.


MMMMDCCCLXXXV - "ERCYCOMECHIDIN"

  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Could force his soul so to his own conceit
  Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
  Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
  O, answer not, but to my closet bring
  Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
  I come by note, to give and to receive.
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
  I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
  Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.


MMMMDCCCLXXXVI - "GTHATTONGUETHA"

  Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
  There let them bide until we have devised
  The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
  Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
  Now must I hide his body in some hole,
  Go with me; if you like upon report
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  And so I pray you all to think yourselves.


MMMMDCCCLXXXVII - "TEVERSWEETWASU"

  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
  Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
  Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
  When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
  And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
  Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
  Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.


MMMMDCCCLXXXVIII - "SEDINGIVINGGEN"

  Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  I may not go without you to the kings.
  Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
  Gelding the opposed continent as much
  Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
  Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  Grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!


MMMMDCCCLXXXIX - "TLEDOOMANDTAUG"

  The very tyranny and rage of his.
  Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  Out of my lean and low ability
  Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
  Making them proud of his humility,
  As level as the cannon to his blank,
  Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  To Italy; and there at Venice gave
  As, to behold desert a beggar born,
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
  Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.


MMMMDCCCXC - "HTITTHUSANEWTO"

  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  That never saw the giant world enraged;
  I did obey, and sent my peasant home
  Than honesty to honesty engaged,
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
  Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
  Save base authority from others' books
  And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
  The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
  Of egal justice, used in such contempt?


MMMMDCCCXCI - "GREETIHATESHEA"

  Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  I fear, too many curses on their beads
  His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
  Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
  Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
  Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
  Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  And from his bosom purge this black despair!


MMMMDCCCXCII - "LTERDWITHANEND"

  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
  Then, at the expiration of the year,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
  I do not without danger walk these streets:
  The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
  He that shall live this day, and see old age,
  And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
  Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?


MMMMDCCCXCIII - "THATFOLLOWDITA"

  Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
  How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
  A truant disposition, good my lord.
  These promises are fair, the parties sure,
  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch
  Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
  Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
  Drove back again unto my native clime?
  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
  And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.


MMMMDCCCXCIV - "SGENTLEDAYDOTH"

  Stand where the torch may not discover us.
  Giving myself a voluntary wound
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  No man so potent breathes upon the ground
  These poor informal women are no more
  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
  Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
  Of such contents as you will wonder at;
  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
  How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!


MMMMDCCCXCV - "FOLLOWNIGHTWHO"

  For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
  Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  That are misled upon your cousin's part;
  Which the conceited painter drew so proud,
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!


MMMMDCCCXCVI - "LIKEAFIENDFROM"

  Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
  For I am falser than vows made in wine;
  I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
  Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
  For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
  Of fourteen; I have known thee already.
  My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.


MMMMDCCCXCVII - "HEAVENTOHELLIS"

  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  And out of question so it is sometimes,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
  She takes a sword and runs at him behind.


MMMMDCCCXCVIII - "FLOWNAWAYIHATE"

  For I am falser than vows made in wine;
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
  O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
  Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Amazedly in her sad face he stares:
  With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
  And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
  Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
  I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
  Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
  Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
  To season love, that of it doth not taste!
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.


MMMMDCCCXCIX - "FROMHATEAWAYSH"

  For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.
  His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
  Art thou not second woman in the realm,
  To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  And by the royalties of both your bloods,
  Where many of the best respect in Rome,
  And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
  Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
  She throws her eyes about the painting round,
  He jests at scars that never felt a wound.


MMMMCM - "ETHREWANDSAVED"

  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
  And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
  Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
  And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
  Defiance to the traitor, and so die?


MMMMCMI - "MYLIFESAYINGNO"

  Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
  You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
  Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
  If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
  For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
  And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
  Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
  Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
  Never did passenger in summer's heat
  O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


MMMMCMII - "TYOUPOORSOULTH"

  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
  Out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
  Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
  Let Hercules himself do what he may,
  Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
  He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.


MMMMCMIII - "ECENTREOFMYSIN"

  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
  Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
  Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.


MMMMCMIV - "FULEARTHWHYFEE"

  Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
  Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
  Let me entreat, for I command no more,
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
  How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
  What merit lived in me, that you should love
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  You have forgot the will I told you of.
  For who digs hills because they do aspire
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?


MMMMCMV - "DSTTHESEREBELP"

  Discredit my authority with yours;
  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
  Threshold till my lord return from the wars.
  That I should wish for thee to help me curse
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  Envy the great nor do the low despise.
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
  But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
  Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
  Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.


MMMMCMVI - "OWERSTHATTHEEA"

  Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
  When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
  The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
  He prays but faintly and would be denied;
  And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
  To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,
  Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
  Had I but served my God with half the zeal
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.


MMMMCMVII - "RRAYWHYDOSTTHO"

  Receiving them from such a worthless post.
  Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
  And be it death proclaimed through our host
  Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
  When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
  How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
  You use in abject and in slavish parts,
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
  Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
  The last that e'er I took her at court,
  The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
  He dies that touches any of this fruit
  Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?


MMMMCMVIII - "UPINEWITHINAND"

  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
  Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
  I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
  If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
  They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
  Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
  I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
  No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?


MMMMCMIX - "SUFFERDEARTHPA"

  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  Until four hundred one and twenty years
  For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
  France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
  His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
  Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
  And what hear there for welcome but my groans?


MMMMCMX - "INTINGTHYOUTWA"

  If with the sap of reason you would quench,
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
  I shall be well content with any choice
  Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
  Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
  Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
  On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.
  Ay, and perversely she persevers so.


MMMMCMXI - "RDWALLSSOCOSTL"

  Real necessities, and give way the while
  Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
  When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
  And chid his truant youth with such a grace
  Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
  Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
  Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
  Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
  Once more adieu! my father at the road
  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
  O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
  She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
  That would have forced your honour and your love;
  Live scandalized and foully spoken of.


MMMMCMXII - "YGAYWHYSOLARGE"

  You are so noble. To your highness' hand
  Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?
  Against the state and profit of this land;
  You holy clergymen, is there no plot
  Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
  Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
  Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
  Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMMCMXIII - "COSTHAVINGSOSH"

  Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
  Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
  Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
  The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
  Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
  And the device he bears upon his shield
  Values itself so highly that to her
  I will proclaim my name about the field:
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
  Stood challenger on mount of all the age
  O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
  Here comes the holy legate of the pope.


MMMMCMXIV - "ORTALEASEDOSTT"

  O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
  The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
  As yet not come to life, who in their seeds
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
  So long in his unlucky Irish wars
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
  Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  They be true; if not true, none were enough.


MMMMCMXV - "HOUUPONTHYFADI"

  He was not sad, for he would shine on those
  Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
  Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
  Unto a view so false will not incline;
  Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
  The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
  You came not of one mother then, it seems.
  Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
  And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Is near the hate of those love not the king.


MMMMCMXVI - "NGMANSIONSPEND"

  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
  And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
  No longer yours than you yourself here live:
  Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
  I do not know that Englishman alive
  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
  Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.


MMMMCMXVII - "SHALLWORMSINHE"

  She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
  He bow'd his nature, never known before
  As sure a card as ever won the set;
  Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
  Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
  Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
  O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
  Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
  My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
  Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
  If thy offences were upon record,
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMMCMXVIII - "RITORSOFTHISEX"

  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Of the great count himself, she is too mean
  From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
  To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
  He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
  I myself fight not once in forty year.
  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
  Each one demand an answer to his part
 eXposing it--but, O, the harder heart!


MMMMCMXIX - "CESSEATUPTHYCH"

  Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
  So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
  Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
  Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
  That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
  Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
  His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.


MMMMCMXX - "ARGEISTHISTHYB"

  As life for honour in fell battle's rage;
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
  Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  Here's all that is left living of your queen,
  Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
  To bring him here alone; although perhaps
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
  Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.


MMMMCMXXI - "ODYSENDTHENSOU"

  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
  Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
  So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
  Did I impale him with the regal crown?
  This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
  How much in duty I am bound to both.
  Exampled by the first pace that is sick
  Now in his life, against your holy oath?
  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
  Until thy head be circled with the same.


MMMMCMXXII - "LLIVETHOUUPONT"

  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  Love loving not itself none other can.
  I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
  The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
  He has no children. All my pretty ones?
  Or, if I live, is it not very like,
  Upon the next live creature that it sees.
  Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
  Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  That with the king here resteth in his tent?


MMMMCMXXIII - "HYSERVANTSLOSS"

  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
  So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
  Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  And, of so great a favour growing proud,
  No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
  This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
  Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
  Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
  O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
  She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,
  Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.


MMMMCMXXIV - "ANDLETTHATPINE"

  A cunning man did calculate my birth
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
  And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
  The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
  Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
  I have not sought the day of this dislike.
  Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMMMCMXXV - "TOAGGRAVATETHY"

  To keep his daughter company; whose loves
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
  Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
  Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  And, by my faith, this league that we have made
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  And yet she hears no tidings of her love:
  That proof is call'd impossibility.
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  To curb the will of the nobility:
  Heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
  Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.


MMMMCMXXVI - "STOREBUYTERMSD"

  Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
  Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
  Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
  You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
  There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
  Some necessaries that I needs must use,
  Discretion; and the fox carries the goose.


MMMMCMXXVII - "IVINEINSELLING"

  I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  In whose comparison all whites are ink,
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  I am resolved to bear a greater storm
  No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  Salutes each other with each other's form;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
  Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
  In his true, native, and most proper shape,
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.


MMMMCMXXVIII - "HOURSOFDROSSWI"

  He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
  O, this will make my mother die with grief!
  Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
  Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?
  From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  So to offend him still. This night's the time
  Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
  Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.


MMMMCMXXIX - "THINBEFEDWITHO"

  That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
  He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
  If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
  Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
  Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
  Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
  I do not without danger walk these streets:
  To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
  Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?


MMMMCMXXX - "UTBERICHNOMORE"

  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
  The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
  Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Came from the north and thus it did import:
  Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
  My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.


MMMMCMXXXI - "SOSHALTTHOUFEE"

  Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
  Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
  Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
  Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
  For how can tyrants safely govern home,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMCMXXXII - "DONDEATHTHATFE"

  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
  Do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  And so farewell until I meet thee next.
  That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
  How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
  Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
  To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMCMXXXIII - "EDSONMENANDDEA"

  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
  Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
  Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
  My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
  Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  And disinherited thine only son.
  Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
  Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  And learn to make a body of a limb.


MMMMCMXXXIV - "THONCEDEADTHER"

  The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
  He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!
  O, that your young nobility could judge
  Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
  Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
  Environ you, till mischief and despair
  Door would speak with you: he says he comes from
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  As well I tender you and all of yours!
  Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.


MMMMCMXXXV - "ESNOMOREDYINGT"

  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  She's such a one, that, were I well assured
  Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
  Of all the voices that we have procured
  Might there not be a charity in sin
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Now was she just before him as he sat,
  Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  This sudden execution of my will.


MMMMCMXXXVI - "HENMYLOVEISASA"

  Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
  Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
  Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
  Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
  Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
  Verona, for a while I take my leave,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  I may not go without you to the kings.
  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
  And climb the highest promontory top.


MMMMCMXXXVII - "FEVERLONGINGST"

  From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
  I would not yield to be your house's guest;
  Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
  Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
  Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.


MMMMCMXXXVIII - "ILLFORTHATWHIC"

  I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
  Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
  List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
  Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
  Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
  Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
  Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
  Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
  Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
  How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
  I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.


MMMMCMXXXIX - "HLONGERNURSETH"

  How would thy shadow's form form happy show
  Leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
  Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
  She would not lose it: her attendants are
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
  He draws Mark Antony out of the way.


MMMMCMXL - "THEDISEASEFEED"

  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
  If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
  Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  And what thou think'st his very action speaks
  Shall then my father's will be of no force
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
  For wise men say it is the wisest course.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.


MMMMCMXLI - "INGONTHATWHICH"

  I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
  No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
  Gave me my being and my father first,
  Or in the night, imagining some fear,
  No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
  Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
  He is already named, and gone to Scone
  And military title capital
  That unassailable holds on his rank,
  Why you proceeded not against these feats
  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  I do not without danger walk these streets:
  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
  He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.


MMMMCMXLII - "DOTHPRESERVETH"

  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
  Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
  Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
  How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.


MMMMCMXLIII - "EILLTHEUNCERTA"

  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
  Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
  Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
  How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
  And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.


MMMMCMXLIV - "INSICKLYAPPETI"

  If low, an agate very vilely cut;
  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
  I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
  Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
  King Henry's peers and chief nobility
  Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
  Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
  And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
  Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
  Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
  Expecting in return twenty for one?
  This done, he took the bride about the neck,
  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.


MMMMCMXLV - "TETOPLEASEMYRE"

  That you divest yourself, and lay apart
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
  Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
  Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
  Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.


MMMMCMXLVI - "ASONTHEPHYSICI"

  Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
  So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
  Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
  Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
  Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
  Hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
  Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
  So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
  If you be king, why should not I succeed?
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.


MMMMCMXLVII - "ANTOMYLOVEANGR"

  Against the use of nature? Present fears
  No, though he thought his accusation true.
  The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
  Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
  You take my house when you do take the prop
  Last, and as much containing as all these,
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  And I will please you what you will demand.
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!


MMMMCMXLVIII - "YTHATHISPRESCR"

  You may as well go stand upon the beach
  To set him free from his captivity.
  Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
  After so long grief, such festivity!
  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
  How came the noble Timon to this change?
  In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
  Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.


MMMMCMXLIX - "IPTIONSARENOTK"

  Inclinable to honour and advance
  Preeminence, and all the large effects
  That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
  In this point charge him home, that he affects
  Or at the least this refuge let me find;
  Never, O never shall I see more joy!
  She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
  And speak between the change of man and boy
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
  Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
  The hazard therefore due fall on me by
  Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!


MMMMCML - "EPTHATHLEFTMEA"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
  Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
  And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
  This little abstract doth contain that large
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
  Limit each leader to his several charge,
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  For making him egregiously an ass
  To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
  My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Above the reach or compass of thy thought?


MMMMCMLI - "NDIDESPERATENO"

  Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
  Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
  If Warwick be so near as men report.
  Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
  Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
  Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
  Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.


MMMMCMLII - "WAPPROVEDESIRE"

  When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,
  And my large kingdom for a little grave,
  Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
  Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
  O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
  Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?


MMMMCMLIII - "ISDEATHWHICHPH"

  In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
  To have a godly peace concluded of
  He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
  Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
  Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
  Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  Profit again should hardly draw me here.
  He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.


MMMMCMLIV - "YSICDIDEXCEPTP"

  You use her well: the world may laugh again;
  Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
  I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
  Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
  Disdaining me and throwing favours on
  I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
  Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
 eXceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  Exist, and be a member of his love
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
  Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?


MMMMCMLV - "ASTCUREIAMNOWR"

  Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
  Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
  The noble duke hath been too much abused.
  Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
  Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
  My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.


MMMMCMLVI - "EASONISPASTCAR"

  Else shall you not have any hand at all
  And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
  Summon their general unto the wall.
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
  Such sweet observance in this work was had,
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
  A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
  So under his insulting falchion lies
  Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
  As if increase of appetite had grown
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMMCMLVII - "EANDFRANTICMAD"

  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  And I unjustly too, must grant it you
  Now where is he that will not stay so long
  Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
  For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  And make a sop of all this solid globe:
  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
  This jarring discord of nobility,
  If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
  As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.


MMMMCMLVIII - "WITHEVERMOREUN"

  Which is a great way growing on the south,
  I think he be transform'd into a beast;
  To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;
  His regiment lies half a mile at least
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each one demand an answer to his part
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
  Of thy intents desires instruction,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Even for revenge mock my destruction!
  Under these windows, white and azure laced
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.


MMMMCMLIX - "RESTMYTHOUGHTS"

  Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
  To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
  My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
  Yet did repent me, after more advice;
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
  On this Ascension-day, remember well,
  Under the canopies of costly state,
  Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
  How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
  Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
  Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?


MMMMCMLX - "ANDMYDISCOURSE"

  Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  Devoured by the unexpected flood.
  Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
  You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
  Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
  In golden palaces, as it becomes.
  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
  Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
  Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
  Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMMCMLXI - "ASMADMENSAREAT"

  A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
  Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
  Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
  All the charactery of my sad brows:
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  May call it back again. Well, believe this,
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  See how the blood is settled in his face.
  And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
  And, after conflict such as was supposed
  The king shall do it: must he be deposed?


MMMMCMLXII - "RANDOMFROMTHET"

  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
  Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
  Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
  Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
  My honourable lords, health to you all!
  That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
  His little speaking shows his love but small.
  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.


MMMMCMLXIII - "RUTHVAINLYEXPR"

  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
  The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
  Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
  Values itself so highly that to her
  And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
  I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
  Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
  Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
  Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
  Engaging and redeeming of himself
 eXcels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.


MMMMCMLXIV - "ESSDFORIHAVESW"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
  She is so hot because the meat is cold;
  Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
  For here I read for certain that my ships
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
  I once did lend my body for his wealth;
  Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
  As surely as my soul intends to live
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  We would as willingly give cure as know.


MMMMCMLXV - "ORNTHEEFAIRAND"

  One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
  Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
  Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief!
  Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
  Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
  Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
  Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
  Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
  Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
  Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.


MMMMCMLXVI - "THOUGHTTHEEBRI"

  Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
  How often hast thou waited at my cup,
  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
  Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
  Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
  Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
  That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
  Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
  I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.


MMMMCMLXVII - "GHTWHOARTASBLA"

  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
  That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
  Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
  Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
  And more, much more. The time will bring it out.
  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  Thy nerves are in their infancy again
  As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
  So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
  But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
  Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
  Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!


MMMMCMLXVIII - "CKASHELLASDARK"

  Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
  And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
  Show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Lives not this day within the city walls:
  Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
  Know I these men that come along with you?


MMMMCMLXIX - "ASNIGHTOMEWHAT"

  Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
  It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  My fortunes to your service, which are here
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
  However, but a folly bought with wit,
  A Roman and a British ensign wave
  Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.


MMMMCMLXX - "EYESHATHLOVEPU"

  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  Edward will always bear himself as king:
  Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
  He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
  As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
  Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
  Unless he do submit himself to Rome.


MMMMCMLXXI - "TINMYHEADWHICH"

  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
  No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
  My life I never held but as a pawn
  Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  And often at his very loose decides
  Disgracing of these colours that I wear
  Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
  Here overcome, as one full of despair,
  I do I know not what, and fear to find
  Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!
  His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.


MMMMCMLXXII - "HAVENOCORRESPO"

  Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
  Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  O, God defend me! how am I beset!
  Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
  Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
  Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
  Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
  Or is he but retired to make him strong?


MMMMCMLXXIII - "NDENCEWITHTRUE"

  Not of this country, though my chance is now
  Devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
  Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Which I shall send you written, be assured,
  I say the earth did shake when I was born.
  The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
  Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  Upon that day either prepare to die
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMMCMLXXIV - "SIGHTORIFTHEYH"

  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
  Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
  How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
  That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
  From him that fled some strange indignity,
  To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
  His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold
  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!


MMMMCMLXXV - "AVEWHEREISMYJU"

  A brittle glory shineth in this face:
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  With swelling ridges; and their ranks began
  He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
  Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
  Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
  Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!


MMMMCMLXXVI - "DGMENTFLEDTHAT"

  Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
  Grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
  My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
  Extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
  Now I begin to relish thy advice;
  The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
  For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
  Look on her, mark her well; be but about
  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Depress'd he is already, and deposed
  The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
  And her prosperities so largely taste,
  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?


MMMMCMLXXVII - "CENSURESFALSEL"

  Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
  Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
  Step forth mine advocate; at your request
  Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
  Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
  For God doth know how many now in health
  And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
  Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
  Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
  Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
  Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.


MMMMCMLXXVIII - "YWHATTHEYSEEAR"

  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
  The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
  That hath beside well in his person wrought
  He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And both return back to their chairs again:
  Receive each other. God speak this Amen!


MMMMCMLXXIX - "IGHTIFTHATBEFA"

  Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
  Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
  I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
  For, were there hope to conquer them again,
  That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
  He fell upon me ere admitted: then
  And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
  To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
  Behind the arras hearing something stir,
  Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
  As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.


MMMMCMLXXX - "IRWHEREONMYFAL"

  In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
  Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  My speech and what is done, tell him he has
  Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them
  For we intend so to dispose you as
  Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
  Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?


MMMMCMLXXXI - "SEEYESDOTEWHAT"

  So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
  Except it be to pray against thy foes.
  Some one be ready with a costly suit,
  Deny your asking: take your choice of those
  Or have we eaten on the insane root
  To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  With amplest entertainment: my free drift
  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
  And who can sever love from charity?
  To give their bed joy and prosperity.


MMMMCMLXXXII - "MEANSTHEWORLDT"

  Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.
  That brought her for this high good turn so far?
  How happily he lives, how well beloved
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
  Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
  The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?


MMMMCMLXXXIII - "OSAYITISNOTSOI"

  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
  Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  An onion will do well for such a shift,
  Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
  I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
  If with too credent ear you list his songs,
  Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
  No doubt they rose up early to observe
  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
  Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
  Send her a story of thy noble acts;
  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
  I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!


MMMMCMLXXXIV - "FITBENOTTHENLO"

  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
  To see the wonders of the world abroad,
  By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  How were they lost? what treachery was used?
  Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.


MMMMCMLXXXV - "VEDOTHWELLDENO"

  Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Of his bright passage to the occident.
  The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
  Have they been merry! which their keepers call
  Which he enforced from me, away he posts
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  Losing his verdure even in the prime
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  England ne'er had a king until his time.
  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!


MMMMCMLXXXVI - "TELOVESEYEISNO"

  Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
  Of noble blood in this declining land.
  Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Your provost knows the place where he abides
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
  She will not stick to round me i' the ear,
  No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
  O, thou wilt be a wilderness again.


MMMMCMLXXXVII - "TSOTRUEASALLME"

  The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
  So please you, let me now be left alone,
  Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
  There is a vent of blood and something blown:
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  As far as doth the Capitol exceed
  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
  Let him depart before we need his help.
  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
  Make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair:
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


MMMMCMLXXXVIII - "NSNOHOWCANITOH"

  Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
  O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
  What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
  Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
  Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.


MMMMCMLXXXIX - "OWCANLOVESEYEB"

  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  What incidency thou dost guess of harm
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
  And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Should many people, under two commands,
  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  Your legs did better service than your hands.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.


MMMMCMXC - "ETRUETHATISSOV"

  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Under that colour am I come to scale
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  The one and other Diomed embraces.
  Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
  And little stars shot from their fixed places,
  Than is her custom: it is still her use
  If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MMMMCMXCI - "EXDWITHWATCHIN"

  Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
 eXtinguishing his conduct in this case;
  Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
  Would I might never stir from off this place,
  I would have left it on the board so soon
  Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
  He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
  Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
  Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
  How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
  If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.


MMMMCMXCII - "GANDWITHTEARSN"

  Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
  All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
  Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
  Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
  Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
  In confutation of which rude reproach
  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
  He saves my labour by his own approach.
  Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
  Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
  Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.


MMMMCMXCIII - "OMARVELTHENTHO"

  O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
  Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
  That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
  Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Not all these lords do vex me half so much
  To do him wrong or any way impeach
  How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!


MMMMCMXCIV - "UGHIMISTAKEMYV"

  Undoing all, as all had never been!
  Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
  Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
  It was a worthy building. How! a page!
  My speech and what is done, tell him he has
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  Start not; her actions shall be holy as
  The fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
  And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
  Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MMMMCMXCV - "IEWTHESUNITSEL"

  It may be so; but yet my inward soul
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  When yond same star that's westward from the pole
  That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
  He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
  Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
  Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
  To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.


MMMMCMXCVI - "FSEESNOTTILLHE"

  For yet may England curse my wretched reign.
  So was I bid report here to the state
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
  Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
  The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
  These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
  I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
  Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
  Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
  Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMMCMXCVII - "AVENCLEARSOCUN"

  As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  Can it not do and undo? I will make
  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
  England we love; and for that England's sake
  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.


MMMMCMXCVIII - "NINGLOVEWITHTE"

  Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
  I know him well. He is the broach indeed
  Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
  Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
  Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
  Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
  If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
  Than wife is to the husband? If this law
  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
  The enemy more mighty than he seems:
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.


MMMMCMXCIX - "ARSTHOUKEEPSTM"

  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  They shall not live within this world, I swear,
  Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
  Or else for ever be confixed here,
  Unable to support this lump of clay,
  Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
  Such are the poor, in health--or else a feast,
  That no man enter till my tale be done.
  Men shut their doors against a setting sun.


MMMMM - "EBLINDLESTEYES"

  Except some petty towns of no import:
  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
  Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
  It shows my earnestness of affection-
  Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
  Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
  Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  She is thy very princess. Who is this?


MMMMMI - "WELLSEEINGTHYF"

  Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
  No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
  That she preparedly may frame herself
  His son am I; deny it, if you can.
  Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
  Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?


MMMMMII - "OULFAULTSSHOUL"

  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
  Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
  From whom we do exist and cease to be;
  And interchangeably set down their hands,
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
  Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
  She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
  His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
  O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Last in the field, and almost lords of it!


MMMMMIII - "DFINDCANSTTHOU"

  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  For more than blushing comes to: if your back
  I should rejoice now at this happy news;
  No face is fair that is not full so black.
  Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
  Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
  And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
  Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
  To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
  These accusations and these grievous crimes
  How did this offer seem received, my lord?
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  Under what colour he commits this ill.


MMMMMIV - "OCRUELSAYILOVE"

  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
  Save that, for reverence to some alive,
  And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
  You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
  It he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
  Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
  O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


MMMMMV - "THEENOTWHENIAG"

  This done, he took the bride about the neck,
  Here are your sons again; and I must lose
  Each in his office ready at thy beck.
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Turn then my freshest reputation to
  We are enow yet living in the field
  His coming hither hath no further scope
  England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  In terms of choice I am not solely led
  And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
  Good king, to be so mightily abused!


MMMMMVI - "AINSTMYSELFWIT"

  Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
  I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
  Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
  Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
  My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
  Your highness came to England, so will I
  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
  Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
  I cannot joy, until I be resolved
  To make confession and to be absolved.


MMMMMVII - "HTHEEPARTAKEDO"

  His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
  Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
  Honour and virtue and conversed with such
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
  Protest my ears were never better fed
  And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  That light we see is burning in my hall.
  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
  King John, this is the very sum of all;
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!


MMMMMVIII - "INOTTHINKONTHE"

  Is held from falling with so weak a wind
  No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
  Her more than haste is mated with delays,
  I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
  Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
  Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
  Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
  Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
  This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
  How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.


MMMMMIX - "EWHENIFORGOTAM"

  Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
  We were to question further: but I now
  He might have bought me at a common price:
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
  I do present you with a man of mine,
  For in the temple by and by with us
  Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
  O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
  Madam, in happy time, what day is that?


MMMMMX - "OFMYSELFALLTYR"

  Of all the world I loved and to him put
  Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
  More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
  You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
  For that same word 'rebellion' did divide
  And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
  They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
  Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.


MMMMMXI - "ANTFORTHYSAKEW"

  A brittle glass that's broken presently:
  Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  For all my reign hath been but as a scene
  O, he is old and blushes not at death.
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  Your highness, lately sending into France,
  Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
  Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
  Knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?


MMMMMXII - "HOHATETHTHEETH"

  Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
  O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
  He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
  And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
  That you and I should meet upon such terms
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
  How shall that faith return again to earth,
  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  He would not stay at your petitions: made
  Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.


MMMMMXIII - "ATIDOCALLMYFRI"

  Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
  I to this fortune that you see me in.
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
  Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
  And, like her true nobility, she has
  Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  My penance is to call Lucetta back
  You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
  For as I am, I live upon the rack.
  Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
  Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.


MMMMMXIV - "ENDONWHOMFROWN"

  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  What would my potent master? here I am.
  Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
  From whence with life he never more sprung up.
  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum.


MMMMMXV - "STTHOUTHATIDOF"

  Shall send between the red rose and the white
  The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
  To understand my purposes aright.
  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
  O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
  Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Heat them and they retort that heat again
  And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.
  Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  O, pity, God, this miserable age!
  French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.


MMMMMXVI - "AWNUPONNAYIFTH"

  As I foretold you, were all spirits and
  Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
  Under an osier growing by a brook,
  Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
  Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
  No vast obscurity or misty vale,
  And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
  Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
  It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
  For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.
  To make confession and to be absolved.
  How he received you, let me be resolved.


MMMMMXVII - "OULOURSTONMEDO"

  O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
  Should many people, under two commands,
  The very train of her worst wearing gown
  On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  My sister may receive it much more worse,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
  Of physiognomy might one behold!


MMMMMXVIII - "INOTSPENDREVEN"

  In Rome, as well as I. mechanic slaves
  Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
  Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
  Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
  So tender over his occasions, true,
  Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
  Did all the chivalry of England move
  Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.


MMMMMXIX - "GEUPONMYSELFWI"

  Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Upon that day either prepare to die
  Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
  Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
  Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
  Must be provided for: and you shall put
  Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
  Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
  France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
  What see you in those papers that you lose
  In thine own person answer thy abuse.


MMMMMXX - "THPRESENTMOANW"

  Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
  Haply a woman's voice may do some good,
  Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;
  Make an extent upon his house and lands.
  O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
  And all the number of his fair demands
  Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
  Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?


MMMMMXXI - "HATMERITDOIINM"

  He couples it to his complaining names.
  As are companions noted and most known
  The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
  My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
  Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,
  Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
  O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
  I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
  I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
  Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
  Madam, I have a secret to reveal.


MMMMMXXII - "YSELFRESPECTTH"

  Your daughter and her cousin much commend
  See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
  Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
  Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Crave harbourage within your city walls.
  Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
  Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
  Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.


MMMMMXXIII - "ATISSOPROUDTHY"

  As my ripe revenue and due by birth
  To Italy; and there at Venice gave
  In argument of praise, or to the worth
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  See what I do deliver out to each,
  Or how haps it I seek not to advance
  Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
  Reignier, her father, to the king of France
  Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
  Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
  The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
  Honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
  You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.


MMMMMXXIV - "SERVICETODESPI"

  Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
  I long with all my heart to see the prince:
  Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
  Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
  In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.


MMMMMXXV - "SEWHENALLMYBES"

  Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  We'll set thy statue in some holy place,
  Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
  Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
  You not your child well loving, yet I find
  Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.


MMMMMXXVI - "TDOTHWORSHIPTH"

  That would depopulate the city and
  Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
  How he her chamber-window will ascend
  Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
  Or the light loss of England for a friend:
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
  Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
  In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  The part my father meant to act upon
  Have been consider'd and debated on.


MMMMMXXVII - "YDEFECTCOMMAND"

  You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
  Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:
  The three-fold world divided, he should stand
  Crave harbourage within your city walls.
  Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
  More than light airs and recollected terms
  My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
  And what we do establish he confirms:
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!


MMMMMXXVIII - "EDBYTHEMOTIONO"

  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
  Because he is protector of the realm,
  Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Methinks they should invite them without knives;
  Oh, he is young and his minority
  The presence of a king engenders love
  In any breast of strong authority,
  On any ground that I am ruler of,
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
  O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!


MMMMMXXIX - "FTHINEEYESBUTL"

  For it is known we were but hollow friends:
  To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  I see you do not mean to part with her;
  Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Expect your highness' doom of life or death.
  Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
  But the main article I do approve
  Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
  These boots too: an they be not, let them hang
  Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?


MMMMMXXX - "OVEHATEONFORNO"

  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
  Ere such another Julius. Britain is
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
  That, in the course of justice, none of us
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  From whence you have them. You are jealous now
  One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
  Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
  No more than I am well acquitted of.
  O, they love least that let men know their love.


MMMMMXXXI - "WIKNOWTHYMINDT"

  With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
  I do believe you think what now you speak;
  King John, your king and England's doth approach,
  Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
  Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
  That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
  He shall do this, or else I do recant
  Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
  My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,
  I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
  Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.


MMMMMXXXII - "HOSETHATCANSEE"

  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  Of mediation, after I am dead,
  Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
  Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.
  Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
  That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
  Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
  All that good time will give us: this attempt
  Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.


MMMMMXXXIII - "THOULOVESTANDI"

  That in the ocean seeks another drop,
  Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
  Open your ears; for which of you will stop
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
  Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
  Either of king or council, when you went
  So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
  Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
  I am the most offending soul alive.


MMMMMXXXIV - "AMBLINDOFROMWH"

  Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
  Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
  By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
  Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
  In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
  Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
  Did steal behind him as he lay along
  O noble English. that could entertain
  From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
  Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
  Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
  Have some unhappy passenger in chase.


MMMMMXXXV - "ATPOWERHASTTHO"

  A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
  Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
  Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
  Of this escape and whither they are bound;
  Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
  A Roman now adopted happily,
  So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-
  Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
  Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?


MMMMMXXXVI - "UTHISPOWERFULM"

  Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
  I say no more than truth, so help me God!
  Slain by his servant, going to put out
  Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
  Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
  Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  Resides not in that man that does not think,--
  For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
  Upon a homely object Love can wink.
  Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
  Marvel how the fishes live in the sea.


MMMMMXXXVII - "IGHTWITHINSUFF"

  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
  God save the king! although I be not he;
  Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
  Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
  Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
  In his true, native, and most proper shape,
  Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
  His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
  I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
  From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
  Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.


MMMMMXXXVIII - "ICIENCYMYHEART"

  I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
  Could witness it, for he was with me then;
  I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
  You envy my advancement and my friends':
  My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
  You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  And often at his very loose decides
  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  Too little payment for so great a debt.


MMMMMXXXIX - "TOSWAYTOMAKEME"

  To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
  Of those that lawless and incertain thought
  So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
  Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
  And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
  You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
  The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
  Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
  And, like a sister, am most loath to call
  Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Madam, I am protector of the realm;
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.


MMMMMXL - "GIVETHELIETOMY"

  Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
  If ever you have look'd on better days,
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  That she with painted images hath spent;
  Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
  Either of king or council, when you went
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  The better act of purposes mistook
  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
  Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
  Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.


MMMMMXLI - "TRUESIGHTANDSW"

  That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  I did present him with the Paris balls.
  Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
  He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
  Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
  And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.


MMMMMXLII - "EARTHATBRIGHTN"

  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
  The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
  Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
  And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
  But prosper better than the Trojan did.
  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
  Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
  Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
  Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.


MMMMMXLIII - "ESSDOTHNOTGRAC"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
  Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
  Did I put Henry from his native right?
  O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
  Thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
  Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
  Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,
  O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
  To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
  Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
  Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.


MMMMMXLIV - "ETHEDAYWHENCEH"

  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
  Here are your sons again; and I must lose
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
  Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
  He hath a person and a smooth dispose
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
  Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Hale him away, and let him talk no more.


MMMMMXLV - "ASTTHOUTHISBEC"

  As well descended as thyself; and hath
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
  That can from Hector bring his honour off,
  Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
  O noble prince, I can discover all
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
  He never was so womanish; the cause
  It would become me better than to close
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  But in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.


MMMMMXLVI - "OMINGOFTHINGSI"

  O, teach me how you look, and with what art
  Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
  I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
  Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
  Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
  O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  From me by strong assault it is bereft.
  To find persistive constancy in men:
  Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
  Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?


MMMMMXLVII - "LLTHATINTHEVER"

  Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
  Let him alone, for I remember now
  To use one language in each several clime
  He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
  And for himself himself be must forsake:
  Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
  I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
  No harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
  To be depender on a thing that leans,
  How many make the hour full complete;
  Ere further leisure yield them further means
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


MMMMMXLVIII - "YREFUSEOFTHYDE"

  You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
  For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
  So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
  Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
  Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;
  How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
  Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
  Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.


MMMMMXLIX - "EDSTHEREISSUCH"

  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
  Discredit my authority with yours;
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
  Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
  Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  If it be made of penetrable stuff;
  She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
  Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
  Come from the north; and as I came along
  Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?


MMMMML - "STRENGTHANDWAR"

  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
  Good fortune and the favour of the king
  To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
  He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
  And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
  Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
  Against the steep uprising of the hill?
  Redeeming time when men think least I will.


MMMMMLI - "RANTIZEOFSKILL"

  Rome shall record, and when I do forget
  And daily new exactions are devised,
  Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
  Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
  I cannot think my sister in the least
  Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
  For on his visage was in little drawn
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
  Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
  Look into these affairs see this main end,
  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


MMMMMLII - "THATINMYMINDTH"

  That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
  Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
  And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
  The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
  Not, black angel; I have no food for thee.
  My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
  You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
  My countryman; but yet I know him not.
  It were not for your quiet nor your good,
  Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
  That we will prosecute by good advice
  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.


MMMMMLIII - "YWORSTALLBESTE"

  You might have been enough the man you are,
  With goodly shape and by your own report
  Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
  Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
  So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
  That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
  And so I was; which plainly signified
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
  But shall be render'd to your public laws
  Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
  The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MMMMMLIV - "XCEEDSWHOTAUGH"

 eXceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
  Cut off the sequence of posterity,
  Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
  Ha! little honour to be much believed,
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
  And that his beauty may the better thrive,
  Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
  He is not with himself; let us withdraw.


MMMMMLV - "TTHEEHOWTOMAKE"

  That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
  Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
  Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
  O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
  Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
  An advocate for an imposter! hush!
  Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMMMLVI - "MELOVETHEEMORE"

  Made to run even upon even ground,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
  Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
  O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMMMMLVII - "THEMOREIHEARAN"

  This heavy-headed revel east and west
  He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,
  O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  Are we all ready? What is now amiss
  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?


MMMMMLVIII - "DSEEJUSTCAUSEO"

  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Even like a man new haled from the rack,
  John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
  Until their greater pleasures first be known
  Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
  There is a vent of blood and something blown:
  Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
  And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.


MMMMMLIX - "FHATEOTHOUGHIL"

  Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
  Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  And I will give a taste of it forthwith
  The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
  Except thou wilt except against my love.
  Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
  Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
  On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
  Upon my head and all this famous land.
  Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
  His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
  In your protectorship you did devise
  Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.


MMMMMLX - "OVEWHATOTHERSD"

  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  Where should be graven, if that right were right,
  His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
  As matching to his youth and vanity,
  That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
  Of Timon man and all humanity!
  That promise noble service: and they come
  Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
  Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.


MMMMMLXI - "OABHORWITHOTHE"

  O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
  And would have kept so long as breath did last!
  By staying there so long till all were lost.
  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
  O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
  Remember whom you are to cope withal;
  Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
  It is too little, helping him to all;
  Than wife is to the husband? If this law
  Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
  O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMMMMLXII - "RSTHOUSHOULDST"

  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
  Then into limits could I bind my woes:
  Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
  See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
  Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
  One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
  Upon the country where you make abode;
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
  Surely, by all the glory you have won,
  To swear against you? such things have been done.


MMMMMLXIII - "NOTABHORMYSTAT"

  Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
  Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
  To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
  As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
  But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
  He that commends me to mine own content
  O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
  You were conducted to a gentle bath
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
  Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
  That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.


MMMMMLXIV - "EIFTHYUNWORTHI"

  Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
  If it conceived a male child by me, should
  For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
  That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
  Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
  Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
  Will bring him to his wonted way again,
  Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  That greatness should so grossly offer it:
  Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
  I shall obey you in all fair commands.


MMMMMLXV - "NESSRAISEDLOVE"

  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
  Sir, I propose not merely to myself
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
  I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
  Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
  Lest rest and lying still might make them look
  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?


MMMMMLXVI - "INMEMOREWORTHY"

  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
  My army but a weak and sickly guard;
  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
  Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
  His means most short, his creditors most strait:
  Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.


MMMMMLXVII - "ITOBEBELOVEDOF"

  I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
  This is an accident of hourly proof,
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
  Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
  But now the substance shall endure the like,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
  Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
  Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
  For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.


MMMMMLXVIII - "THEELOVEISTOOY"

  Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
  His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
  Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
  Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
  Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.


MMMMMLXIX - "OUNGTOKNOWWHAT"

  O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
  Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
  That ever yet this land was guilty of.
  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
  No, when my father York and Edward wept,
  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
  When to her beauty I commend my vows,
  Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  And put your trial in the villain's mouth
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.


MMMMMLXX - "CONSCIENCEISYE"

  Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  Nature dispenses with the deed so far
  Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  I would attach you all and make you stoop
  Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
  No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
  Could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
  Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
  Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
  Else with the like I had requited him.


MMMMMLXXI - "TWHOKNOWSNOTCO"

  The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  He held me last night at least nine hours
  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
  So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
  No occupation; all men idle, all;
  Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
  These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
  Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
  Of all his wars within the realm of France?


MMMMMLXXII - "NSCIENCEISBORN"

  Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
  She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
  Caesar and Antony have ever won
  In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;
  England shall give him office, honour, might;
  Now when the lords and barons of the realm
  Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  I have from their confines call'd to enact
  Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
  Before I would have granted to that act.
  Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
  Reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Never yet taint with love, I send the king.


MMMMMLXXIII - "OFLOVETHENGENT"

  Of moving accidents by flood and field
  Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
  Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  That's he that was Othello: here I am.
  Hath been between this lady and this lord.
  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
  No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Nay, if you read this line, remember not
  To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?


MMMMMLXXIV - "LECHEATERURGEN"

  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Consent to pay thee that I never had!
  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
  The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
  Upon the instant that she was accused,
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  Good king, to be so mightily abused!
  East, west, north, south; or like a school broke up,
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.


MMMMMLXXV - "OTMYAMISSLESTG"

  On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
  That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
  Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
  Your exposition on the holy text
  And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
  Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we
  I saw't this morning: confident I am
  Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
  She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
  To death or to dishonour; and my end
  Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.


MMMMMLXXVI - "UILTYOFMYFAULT"

  Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
  Insulting tyranny begins to jet
  Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
  Than ever at one time the clergy yet
  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
  From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
  Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
  Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
  False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?
  As this is false he burdens me withal!
  Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
  Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
  Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.


MMMMMLXXVII - "STHYSWEETSELFP"

  Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
  The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
  Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  Your sauciness will jest upon my love
  Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
  Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
  Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  That lie within the mercy of your wit.
  Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
  For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
  Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?


MMMMMLXXVIII - "ROVEFORTHOUBET"

  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  On a dissension of a doit, break out
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  For some displeasing service I have done,
  Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
  Honour and virtue and conversed with such
  Or did he make the jest against his will?
  Unless I flatter with myself too much.
  Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.


MMMMMLXXIX - "RAYINGMEIDOBET"

  Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
  And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
  Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
  Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
  More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
  Drew to defend him when he was beset:
  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
  But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
  Else with the like I had requited him.
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.


MMMMMLXXX - "RAYMYNOBLERPAR"

  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
  And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,
  You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
  My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  Never was such a sudden scholar made;
  Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
  Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
  Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  Perchance some single vantages you took.
  An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.


MMMMMLXXXI - "TTOMYGROSSBODY"

  The strongest body shall it make most weak,
  The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
  On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
  My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
  You will bestow her on Orlando here?
  Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
  On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
  So to enforce or qualify the laws
  By such invention as I can devise?
  O thou fond many, with what loud applause
  Did to his predecessors part withal.
  Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.


MMMMMLXXXII - "STREASONMYSOUL"

  So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
  Repair'd with double riches of content.
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And shall, or him we will accompany.
  So that by this intelligence we learn
  Or else you like not of my company.
  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
  Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
  Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
  Upon my head and all this famous land.
  Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.


MMMMMLXXXIII - "DOTHTELLMYBODY"

  Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
  O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
  The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
  Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
  The king and his companions: warily
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
  My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
  Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
  Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
  Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
  Deliver up my title in the queen
  Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.


MMMMMLXXXIV - "THATHEMAYTRIUM"

  Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
  He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
  As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
  This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
  Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
  Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
  Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
  That the great figure of a council frames
  Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
  I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  Unless it be to think that she is by
  More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?


MMMMMLXXXV - "PHINLOVEFLESHS"

  Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
  He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
  If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
  Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
  Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
  Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
  Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
  Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
  So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.


MMMMMLXXXVI - "TAYSNOFATHERRE"

  They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
  And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
  You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
  Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
  Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
  Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
  That love the fundamental part of state
  Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
  Right joyous are we to behold your face,
  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.


MMMMMLXXXVII - "ASONBUTRISINGA"

  Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
  She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
  O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
  But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
  Remember me at court; where I was taught
  If you respect them, best to take them up.
  So fair an outward and such stuff within
  I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
  Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
  Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
  And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.


MMMMMLXXXVIII - "TTHYNAMEDOTHPO"

  The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
  Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
  His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
  You never shall, so help you truth and God!
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
  A precious ring, a ring that I must use
  My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
  Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
  Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
  Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
  That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
  O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?


MMMMMLXXXIX - "INTOUTTHEEASHI"

  Is now in England, ransacking the church,
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  O prudent discipline! From north to south:
  Under whose colours he had fought so long.
  Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  Their father was too weak, and they too strong,
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
  Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
  His present and your pains we thank you for:
  I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.


MMMMMXC - "STRIUMPHANTPRI"

  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
  The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
  Upon your oath of service to the pope,
  My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
  Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
  His spell in that is out: the king hath found
  And interchangeably hurl down my gage
  Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
  The choice and master spirits of this age.
  Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  Respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
  I give to baser life. So; have you done?


MMMMMXCI - "ZEPROUDOFTHISP"

  Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
  Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
  Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
  Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
  Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
  That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
  How shall we then dispense with that contract,
  It were a shame to let this land by lease;
  So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
  Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.


MMMMMXCII - "RIDEHEISCONTEN"

  Resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
  I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
  Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  I shall be well content with any choice
  Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
  Of such as have before endured the like.
  Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
  The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.


MMMMMXCIII - "TEDTHYPOORDRUD"

  Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Delighted them in any other form;
  Till the prince came, who parted either part.
  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
  Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
  Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.


MMMMMXCIV - "GETOBETOSTANDI"

  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
  Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
  But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
  Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
  Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.
  To take the basest and most poorest shape
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
  I am ambitious for a motley coat.


MMMMMXCV - "NTHYAFFAIRSFAL"

  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  The petty difference, we yet not know.
  Herself most chastely absent: after this,
  You understand me not that tell me so:
  About it; for it stands me much upon,
  For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
  For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
  And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
  She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
  For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
  And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
  Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.


MMMMMXCVI - "LBYTHYSIDENOWA"

  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
  Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
  You know that I held Epicurus strong
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
  You four, from hence to prison back again;
  Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
  In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
  O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
  What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?
  And with the same to act controlling laws.


MMMMMXCVII - "NTOFCONSCIENCE"

  Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please
  To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
  O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
  Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  O cruel, irreligious piety!
  Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
  Such barren pleasures, rude society,
  Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
  I am with both: each army hath a hand;
  Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
  No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
  England ne'er had a king until his time.


MMMMMXCVIII - "HOLDITTHATICAL"

  His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  Of his own body he was ill, and gave
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
  Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
  I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
  The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
  To what we wildly do, so we profess
  How I have thought of this and of these times,
  A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
  There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
  I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
  Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
  As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!


MMMMMXCIX - "LHERLOVEFORWHO"

  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
  Have aught committed that is hardly borne
  Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
  Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
  Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
  For I will board her though she chide as loud
  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
  Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
  How now! what means death in this rude assault?
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.


MMMMMC - "SEDEARLOVEIRIS"

  So to the laws at large I write my name:
  Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
  Dim register and notary of shame!
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  As gentle tell me, of what honour was
  Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
  Let me entreat to know at large the cause
  O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
  Very hardly upon such a subject.
  Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
  In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
  She is not for your turn, the more my grief.


MMMMMCI - "EANDFALLINLOVI"

  Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
  And some are yet ungotten and unborn
  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
  And yet the king not privy to my drift,
  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
  Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
  I fear it is too choleric a meat.
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
  Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.


MMMMMCII - "NGTHEETHOUKNOW"

  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
  Go with me; if you like upon report
  This morning for ten thousand of your throats
  His time of folly and his time of sport;
  Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  The prey wherein by nature they delight;
  He sends you this most memorable line,
  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
  Under the canopies of costly state,
  Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
  Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.


MMMMMCIII - "STIAMFORSWORNB"

  See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
  The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
  If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
  And rotten times that you shall look upon
  My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
  From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
  Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
  Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
  Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
  O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
  Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  Never did faithful subject more rejoice
  But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?


MMMMMCIV - "UTTHOUARTTWICE"

  Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
  To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
  How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
  And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
  The other lords, like lions wanting food,
  Then 'tis but reason that I be released
  Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
  I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
  Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.


MMMMMCV - "FORSWORNTOMELO"

  Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
  Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
  Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  Neither regarding that she is my child
  They call him Troilus, and on him erect
  Of thy deep duty more impression show
  More upon humour than advised respect.
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
  Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!


MMMMMCVI - "VESWEARINGINAC"

  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
  Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
  And we mean well in going to this mask;
  Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
  I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
  Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
  A goodly day not to keep house, with such
  Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?


MMMMMCVII - "TTHYBEDVOWBROK"

  To let him spend his time no more at home,
  They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
  He hath brought many captives home to Rome
  You take me in too dolorous a sense;
  But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
  Values itself so highly that to her
  Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
  When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
  By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
  Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!


MMMMMCVIII - "EANDNEWFAITHTO"

  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
  Not possible; for who shall bear your part
  Done to me, undeserving as I am,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
  And to that woman, when she has done most,
  If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
  The setting sun, and music at the close,
  How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  Of marching to Philippi presently?


MMMMMCIX - "RNINVOWINGNEWH"

  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
  I cannot make you what amends I would,
  Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
  Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
  I fear it is too choleric a meat.
  Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
  Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
  Now, if you have a station in the file,
  Even for this let us divided live,
  What then remains, we being thus arrived
  He durst not sit there, had your father lived.


MMMMMCX - "ATEAFTERNEWLOV"

  Another thing to fall. I not deny,
  Though you can guess what temperance should be,
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  And look on death itself! up, up, and see
  Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
  To make a shaking fever in your walls,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
  Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  Which is a great way growing on the south,
  Let them have scope: though what they do impart
  O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMMMCXI - "EBEARINGBUTWHY"

  England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
  But that the earthy and cold hand of death
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
  Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
  No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
  By which the world's best garden be achieved,
  Upon my hateful life. Another way
  This is not strong enough to be believed
  We may effect this business yet ere day.
  His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
  Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.


MMMMMCXII - "OFTWOOATHSBREA"

  One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
  For wise men say it is the wisest course.
  Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
  Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
  One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
  And finding him, the searchers of the town,
  To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
  Higher, or return again into France?
  Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
  But thou art all my art and dost advance
  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
  And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.


MMMMMCXIII - "CHDOIACCUSETHE"

  Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  Is true and false; and what he with his oath
  And made their bends adornings: at the helm
  Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
  Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
  Unless a brother should a brother dare
  Such barren pleasures, rude society,
  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
  Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MMMMMCXIV - "EWHENIBREAKTWE"

  Environed with all these hideous fears?
  Whereon to practise your severity.
  Hath from the number of his banish'd years
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  If he were seated as King Edward is.
  But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  And mark what object did present itself.
  Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
  To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
  When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.


MMMMMCXV - "NTYIAMPERJURED"

  No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
  This milky gentleness and course of yours,
  You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,
  Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
  Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
  Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  Religious in mine error, I adore
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  During the time Edward the Third did reign.


MMMMMCXVI - "MOSTFORALLMYVO"

  My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
  Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
  So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
  For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
  O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
  Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
  Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
  You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
  One that attends your ladyship's command.


MMMMMCXVII - "WSAREOATHSBUTT"

  With too much urging your pernicious lives,
  Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
  Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
  And such an instrument I was to use.
  This picture she advisedly perused,
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
  Black and portentous must this humour prove,
  Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
  Then afterward up higher: but there is
  To dispossess that child which is not his?


MMMMMCXVIII - "OMISUSETHEEAND"

  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
  My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
  Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
  Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
  Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
  Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  To tread a measure with you on this grass.
  Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
  Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
  No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.


MMMMMCXIX - "ALLMYHONESTFAI"

  As I upon advantage did remove,
  Let him be ransom'd: never master had
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
  My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
  You are so merciful: I see your end;
  Hence with it, and together with the dam
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
  England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
  So under his insulting falchion lies
  Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
  For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
  As it is known she is, these moral laws
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.


MMMMMCXX - "THINTHEEISLOST"

  The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
  Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
  Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
  So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
  Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
  Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
  Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
  That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.


MMMMMCXXI - "FORIHAVESWORND"

  Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;
  Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
  Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
  I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
  How much the quantity, the weight as much,
  All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
  Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
  Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
  Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
  Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
  Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
  Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?


MMMMMCXXII - "EEPOATHSOFTHYD"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
  Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
  O that my prayers could such affection move!
  Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
  There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
  Or that we would, against the form of law,
  For which I will divide my crown with her,
  Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
  How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
  You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
  Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.


MMMMMCXXIII - "EEPKINDNESSOAT"

  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
  Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
  Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
  Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
  O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
  A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  To your protection I commend me, gods.


MMMMMCXXIV - "HSOFTHYLOVETHY"

  Hear from me still, and never of me aught
  Some entertainment for them in their tents.
  O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
  From son to son, some four or five descents
  Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
  Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
  Visit the speechless sick and still converse
  Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
  That I should wish for thee to help me curse
  Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!


MMMMMCXXV - "TRUTHTHYCONSTA"

  To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
  Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
  Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
  That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
  Till after many accents and delays,
  Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
  Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
  Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
  Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
  Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
  Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
  This very night; for Love is like a child,
  Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!


MMMMMCXXVI - "NCYANDTOENLIGH"

  Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
  Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
  As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
  Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
  Do summon us to part and bid good night.
  Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
  Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
  Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
  He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.


MMMMMCXXVII - "TENTHEEGAVEEYE"

  That we find out the cause of this effect-
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,
  Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
  Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
  God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
  Art thou not second woman in the realm,
  Virtue he had, deserving to command:
  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
  Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.


MMMMMCXXVIII - "STOBLINDNESSOR"

  Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
  The fountain from the which my current runs,
  O, two such silver currents, when they join,
  Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
  Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
  In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
  No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
  Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
  O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


MMMMMCXXIX - "MADETHEMSWEARA"

  My woeful self up in a mourning house,
  Are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Enough to stifle such a villain up.
  Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
  Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
  My heart fly to your service; there resides,
  She modestly prepares to let them know
  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
  Early and late, debating to and fro
  And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?


MMMMMCXXX - "GAINSTTHETHING"

  Give him direction for this merry bond,
  Against the steep uprising of the hill?
  Into the law of children. Be not fond,
  No honourable trust. I have done ill;
  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
  That does infect the land: with which they moved
  The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
  How I have ever loved the life removed
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
  No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.


MMMMMCXXXI - "THEYSEEFORIHAV"

  The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
  He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
  You see how simple and how fond I am.
  Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
  Either of you to be the other's end.
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  For to no other pass my verses tend
  O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
  Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
  If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
  How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
  And with the other fling it at thy face,
  Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.


MMMMMCXXXII - "ESWORNTHEEFAIR"

  Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
  Save base authority from others' books
  When he to madding Dido would unfold
  O, full of careful business are his looks!
  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
  How say you now? is not your husband mad?
  Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  First, in this forest let us do those ends
  As though she bid me stay by her a week;
  I have with such provision in mine art
  Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.


MMMMMCXXXIII - "MOREPERJUREDIT"

  Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
  O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--
  Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
  Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  Upon his party for the gain thereof:
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
  I think so too; for never gazed the moon
  That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?


MMMMMCXXXIV - "OSWEARAGAINSTT"

  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
  Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  And like a mountain, not to be removed.
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
  And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
  Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
  Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
  The king hath many marching in his coats.


MMMMMCXXXV - "HETRUTHSOFOULA"

  Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
  Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
  Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  Reply not in how many fathoms deep
  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
  That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
  Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
  For has not the divine Apollo said,
  O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
  Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
  And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.


MMMMMCXXXVI - "LIECUPIDLAIDBY"

  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
  I am a feather for each wind that blows:
  Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
  Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
  Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
  If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Do shameful execution on herself.
  But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
  You hold too heinous a respect of grief.


MMMMMCXXXVII - "HISBRANDANDFEL"

  Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
  If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
  Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  By innocence I swear, and by my youth
  Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
  Never came poison from so sweet a place.
  Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
  Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
  For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
  Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?


MMMMMCXXXVIII - "LASLEEPAMAIDOF"

  Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
  And then comes answer like an Absey book:
  Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
  Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
  Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
  As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
  Or whether revolution be the same.
  Free from these slanders and this open shame!


MMMMMCXXXIX - "DIANSTHISADVAN"

  Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
  It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
  And die as fast as they see others grow;
  Niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
  She would not lose it: her attendants are
  Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
  I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
  Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
  Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
  And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
  Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.


MMMMMCXL - "TAGEFOUNDANDHI"

  That we must curb it upon others' proof;
  And to his protestation urged the rest,
  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
  O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
  Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
  No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
  Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
  Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
  Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
  Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,
  Is't possible you will away to-night?


MMMMMCXLI - "SLOVEKINDLINGF"

  Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
  Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
  O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
  I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
  Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
  Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  I pray you do not fall in love with me,
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
  For I have bought it with an hundred blows.


MMMMMCXLII - "IREDIDQUICKLYS"

  I speak of Africa and golden joys.
  Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
  Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
  Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
  Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
  I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
  Carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
  Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
  Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
  You never had a servant to whose trust
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust.


MMMMMCXLIII - "TEEPINACOLDVAL"

  This night forestall him of the coming day!
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
  Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
  I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
  Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
  And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
  Corrupting in its own fertility.
  One hundred twenty six: added to these,
  Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
  Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
  Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
  And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
  Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.


MMMMMCXLIV - "LEYFOUNTAINOFT"

  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
  Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
  Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
  O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
  To my inheritance of free descent.
  And not deface your honour with reproach?
  I go: and towards three or four o'clock
  Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
  For the instalment of this noble duke
  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.


MMMMMCXLV - "HATGROUNDWHICH"

  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
  And hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
  The ample proposition that hope makes
  God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
  Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
  O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
  Under the lordly monarch of the north,
  No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
  Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
  I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
  Could to no issue of true honour bring.
  Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.


MMMMMCXLVI - "BORROWDFROMTHI"

  Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
  On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
  Or as a moat defensive to a house,
  Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
  Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
  For in the marches here we heard you were,
  Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
  Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
  Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
  How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
  I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?


MMMMMCXLVII - "SHOLYFIREOFLOV"

  Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
  Your gracious self to take on you the charge
  For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
  I long to know the truth hereof at large.
  Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
  Enow to press a royal merchant down
  Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
  For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
  Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMMMMCXLVIII - "EADATELESSLIVE"

  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
  Divide your happy England into four;
  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
  That you would have me seek into myself
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
  Either to get the town again or die:
  So offers he to give what she did crave;
  She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
  Let him have time against himself to rave,
  Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
  Valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!


MMMMMCXLIX - "LYHEATSTILLTOE"

  Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
  York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
  How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  According to the measure of their states.
  To an infected jelly and my name
  Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
  This widow lady? In her right we came;
  In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
  Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
  Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
  Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.


MMMMMCL - "NDUREANDGREWAS"

  Never so much as in a thought unborn
  Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
  Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
  Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
  And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
  Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
  So then two bosoms and a single troth.


MMMMMCLI - "EETHINGBATHWHI"

  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
  I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
  Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
  Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
  But more of that anon. Take him aside.
  And future ages groan for this foul act;
  The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
  How joyful am I made by this contract!
  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
  Her new-built virtue and obedience.
  In forwarding this dear expedience.


MMMMMCLII - "CHYETMENPROVEA"

  Could all my travels warrant me they live.
  His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
  You are my all the world, and I must strive
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
  Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
  Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
  Or with the clamorous report of war
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
  And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.


MMMMMCLIII - "GAINSTSTRANGEM"

  Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
  And here he means to spend his time awhile:
  If they return in their own shapes to woo?
  Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
  Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
  The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
  Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
  That chase thee from thy country and expose
  Rather than render back, out with your knives,
  After all this, how did he bear himself?
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  My lord, you take us even at the best.


MMMMMCLIV - "ALADIESASOVERE"

  As after some oration fairly spoke
  Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
  I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  So much against the mettle of your sex,
  And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
  Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.


MMMMMCLV - "IGNCUREBUTATMY"

  Is spotless reputation: that away,
  Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
  No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
  Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
  Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
  Unmeritable shuns your high request.
  Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
  And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
  That I some lady trifles have reserved,
  Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
  Yet this I will not do, do how I can.


MMMMMCLVI - "MISTRESSEYELOV"

  My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
  I may not suffer you to visit them;
  Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
  Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
  Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
  Envy your great deservings and good name,
  Should a like language use to all degrees
  Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
  Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
  Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
  Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
  Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf
  Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


MMMMMCLVII - "ESBRANDNEWFIRE"

  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
  By staying there so long till all were lost.
  Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
  Again in pity of my hard distress
  Nor construe any further my neglect,
  Deliver them, and your appeal to us
  Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
  For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
  It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
  Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  Else you may be marvellously mistook.


MMMMMCLVIII - "DTHEBOYFORTRIA"

  Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
  They come like sacrifices in their trim,
  Her more than haste is mated with delays,
  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
  But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
  Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
  You less know how to value her desert
  From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which
  Of both your armies; whose equality
  Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
  That will be thaw'd from the true quality
  Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
  I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
  And drive his purpose on to these delights.


MMMMMCLIX - "LNEEDSWOULDTOU"

  Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,
  Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
  Except some petty towns of no import:
  Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
  Do not desire to see this letter.
  Spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
  When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
  O me! come near me now I am much ill.
  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
  Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
  Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
  To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
  Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
  Upon the left hand of the even field.


MMMMMCLX - "CHMYBREASTISIC"

  Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
  His deeds with doing them, and is content
  Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
  Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
  By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
  Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
  That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
  I must unto the road, to disembark
  Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
  Is it no more to be your daughter than
  Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?


MMMMMCLXI - "KWITHALTHEHELP"

  Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
  Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
  I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
  Thy letters have transported me beyond
  He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
  And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
  Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
  Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
  He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  He makes me angry with him; for he seems
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
  Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!


MMMMMCLXII - "OFBATHDESIREDA"

  O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
  For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
  But not for that dream I on this strange course,
  At the temple, and there, before the whole
  That he which is was wish'd until he were;
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Death: her death itself, which could not be her
  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
  Sir, I commend you to your own content.
  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
  Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
  Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
  And thither bear your treasure and your goods.


MMMMMCLXIII - "NDTHITHERHIEDA"

  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
  Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
  Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
  I would that I were low laid in my grave:
  This I must do, or know not what to do;
  Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
  Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
  Robs me of that which not enriches him
  Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
  If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
  Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
  Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
  And by herself, I will not tell you whose.


MMMMMCLXIV - "SADDISTEMPERDG"

  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
  And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
  Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
  It may be I shall raise you by and by
  So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
  The sweat of industry would dry and die,
  Every man shift for all the rest, and
  My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
  Plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
  Endue you with the people's voice: remains
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


MMMMMCLXV - "UESTBUTFOUNDNO"

  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
  She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
  Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
  But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
  Uproar the universal peace, confound
  Tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
  Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
  Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
  Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
  Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
  Offer their own lives in their young's defence?


MMMMMCLXVI - "CURETHEBATHFOR"

  Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
  Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
  Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
  Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
  To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
  Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  But join in friendship, as your lords have done.
  Attend the true event, and put we on
  Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
  For when we rage, advice is often seen
  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
  Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.


MMMMMCLXVII - "MYHELPLIESWHER"

  My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
  Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
  How often said, my dignity would last
  Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
  Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  So from himself impiety hath wrought,
  Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
  His father never was so true begot:
  Even so void is your false heart of truth.
  Remains in danger of her former tooth.


MMMMMCLXVIII - "ECUPIDGOTNEWFI"

  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
  Could say she were worse: think you of a worse
  Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
  Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
  If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
  Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
  Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
  That should be in a Roman you do want,
  Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
  Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
  I was preserved to serve this noble count.


MMMMMCLXIX - "REMYMISTRESSEY"

  Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
  You have no children, butchers! if you had,
  May deem that you are worthily deposed.
  I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
  So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
  That honourable grief lodged here which burns
  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  Seeming to bury that posterity
  Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
  Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.


MMMMMCLXX - "ESTHELITTLELOV"

  Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
  Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
  That you affect; and so must you resolve,
  Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
  Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  In the division of each several crime,
  To mend the petty present, I will piece
  The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
  Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
  Each present lord began to promise aid,
  Lysander and myself will fly this place.
  O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
  Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


MMMMMCLXXI - "EGODLYINGONCEA"

  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
  Good parts aside I have no other charms.
  Open as day for melting charity;
  Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
  You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
  I here importune death awhile, until
  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
  Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
  Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
  Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
  Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
  Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
  And knows not how to do it but with tears.


MMMMMCLXXII - "SLEEPLAIDBYHIS"

  Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
  Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
  Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
  End in one purpose, and be all well borne
  Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
  Look after him and cannot do him good,
  And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
  I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
  Discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
  But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
  Your highness told me I should post before.
  He calls me to a restitution large
  I am his first-born son, that was the last
  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.


MMMMMCLXXIII - "SIDEHISHEARTIN"

  Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
  Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
  Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
  He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
  If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
  Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.
  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
  Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
  At my depart, these were his very words:
  Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
  No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.


MMMMMCLXXIV - "FLAMINGBRANDWH"

  Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
  Lives not this day within the city walls:
  And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
  Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
  I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
  Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
  Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
  And much too little of that good I saw
  No other obligation! By my life,
  Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
  While other sports are tasking of their minds,
  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.


MMMMMCLXXV - "ILSTMANYNYMPHS"

  If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
  That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
  Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
  As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
  Necessity will make us all forsworn
  You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
  Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
  Much like a press of people at a door,
  Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
  So, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?


MMMMMCLXXVI - "THATVOWDCHASTE"

  To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
  How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
  Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
  Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!
  Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
  Offence of mighty note; but to himself
  Which is the side that I must go withal?
  Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
  Happy the parents of so fair a child;
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
  So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
  Thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMMMCLXXVII - "LIFETOKEEPCAME"

  Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
  In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
  Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
  Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Either to die the death or to abjure
  Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
  A thing divine, for nothing natural
  Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.


MMMMMCLXXVIII - "TRIPPINGBYBUTI"

  That for thyself: I will not so presume
  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
  In doing courtesies, and one in whom
  Play with your fancies, and in them behold
  Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
  If you should die before him, where's her dower?
  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Get the learned writer to set down our
  Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
  But such a face should bear a wicked mind.
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
  The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
  I do repent it from my very soul.


MMMMMCLXXIX - "NHERMAIDENHAND"

  Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
  Either thou art most ignorant by age,
  Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
  My head with more ill news, for it is full.
  And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
  Did ever Dian so become a grove
  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
  Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
  Are of imagination all compact:
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  Dear general, I never gave you cause.


MMMMMCLXXX - "THEFAIRESTVOTA"

  There is no malice in this burning coal;
  He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
  And do invite you to my sister's view,
  I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
  Reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
  Establish him in his true sense again,
  Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
  The people fear me; for they do observe
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
  That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
  And a true lover of the holy church.


MMMMMCLXXXI - "RYTOOKUPTHATFI"

  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
  Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
  Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
  O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
  Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
  Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
  Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
  Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
  And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
  That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,
  Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
  In this the heaven figures some event.


MMMMMCLXXXII - "REWHICHMANYLEG"

  Remuneration for the thing it was;
  Empale him with your weapons round about;
  With all your just proceedings in this cause.
  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
  If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
  Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
  Having first seized his books, or with a log
  Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
  And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:
  Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
  Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
  Let me be blest to make this happy close;
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  Giving my verdict on the white rose side.


MMMMMCLXXXIII - "IONSOFTRUEHEAR"

  I did not see you since you sent me hence,
  Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
  No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
  So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
  From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
  To what is count's man: count's master is of
  Return those duties back as are right fit,
  Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
  Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
  He was as calm as virtue--he began
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
  And all in war with Time for love of you,
  Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.


MMMMMCLXXXIV - "TSHADWARMDANDS"

  Till that the nature of your fault be known
  Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
  Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
  As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
  Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
  What is the issue of the business there.
  And fit it with such furniture as suits
  Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
  My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
  Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
  And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
  Never came reformation in a flood,
  Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.


MMMMMCLXXXV - "OTHEGENERALOFH"

  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
  His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
  Either they must be dieted like mules
  Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
  Each man apart, all single and alone,
  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  And dispossessing all my other parts
  Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
  O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
  For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!
  Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.


MMMMMCLXXXVI - "OTDESIREWASSLE"

  O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
  Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
  In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
  Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
  Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
  Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
  And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
  Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
  Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


MMMMMCLXXXVII - "EPINGBYAVIRGIN"

  Else would he never so demean himself.
  Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
  I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
  But prosper better than the Trojan did.
  You all look strangely on me; and you most.
  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
  Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
  Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
  God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
  Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
  Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.


MMMMMCLXXXVIII - "HANDDISARMDTHI"

  How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
  An't please your grace, the two great cardinals
  Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
  Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
  Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
  It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
  So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
  Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
  Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
  My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
  Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
  Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.


MMMMMCLXXXIX - "SBRANDSHEQUENC"

  She gave me none, except an angry word.
  But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
  Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
  And I, her husband, contradict your banes.
  No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
  Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
  Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
  Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
  Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
  Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
  Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  No further halting: satisfy me home
  Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.


MMMMMCXC - "HEDINACOOLWELL"

  Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
  Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
  It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
  Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
  And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
  Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
  Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
  Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
  Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.
  We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
  Else had she with her father rang'd along.
  Like softest music to attending ears!
  Longer than I have time to tell his years!


MMMMMCXCI - "BYWHICHFROMLOV"

  Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
  Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
  Which is a great way growing on the south,
  He hath refused it in the open court:
  It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
  Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
  For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
  My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made
  Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
  Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?


MMMMMCXCII - "ESFIRETOOKHEAT"

  Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
  So in the earth, to this day is not known:
  For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
  I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
  Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
  Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
  That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
  Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
  Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
  Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
  He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
  Expect him here: when he shall come and find
  A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
  To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.


MMMMMCXCIII - "PERPETUALGROWI"

  Prejudicates the business and would seem
  Each hath his place and function to attend:
  Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
  England, impatient of your just demands,
  The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
  Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
  And grows to something of great constancy;
  Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
  Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.
  Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
  Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
  What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
  In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.


MMMMMCXCIV - "NGABATHANDHEAL"

  No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
  Grow great by your example and put on
  An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
  But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
  Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
  Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
  Her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
  And followed with a rabble that rejoice
  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
  Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
  Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
  And you, my lords, remember where we are,
  Like captives bound to a triumphant car.


MMMMMCXCV - "THFULREMEDYFOR"

  Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
  Her times of preservation, which perforce
  Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
  Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
  Ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
  Excepting one, I would he were the best
  Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
  Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
  Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
  Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
  For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
  Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
  Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.


MMMMMCXCVI - "MENDISEASEDBUT"

  Make verbal repetition of her moans;
  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
  Is able with the change to kill and cure.
  Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
  And brought to medicine a healthful state
  So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
  Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
  Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
  But that her flight prevented it, she had
  Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
  This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.


MMMMMCXCVII - "IMYMISTRESSTHR"

  I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
  Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
  Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
  I should report that which I say I saw,
  Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
  Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
  Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
  Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
  Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
  Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
  How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
  Revenge upon myself with present moan?


MMMMMCXCVIII - "ALLCAMETHEREFO"

  Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!
  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
  Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
  Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
  Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
  England is safe, if true within itself?
  To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
  He will the rather do it when he sees
  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
  Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
  O, full of careful business are his looks!


MMMMMCXCIX - "RCUREANDTHISBY"

  Regard me as I do not flatter, and
  Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
  Upon my head and all this famous land.
  Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
  Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
  And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
  I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
  But not intentively: I did consent,
  Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.


MMMMMCC - "THATIPROVELOVE"

  Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;
  To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
  Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
  O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
  Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
  Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.


MMMMMCCI - "SFIREHEATSWATE"

  Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
  For aye austerity and single life.
  In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
  Render me worthy of this noble wife!
  Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
  His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
  That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
  She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
  Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  To measure out my length on this cold bed.
  Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.


MMMMMCCII - "RWATERCOOLSNOT"

  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
  While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
  A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
  Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
  Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
  Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
  Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
  Like little body with a mighty heart,
  Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
  Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
  O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
  Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.


Envoi - "LOVE"

  Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
  On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.


THE END
